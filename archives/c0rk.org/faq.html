<h1><u><strong>FAQ</strong></u></h1>
<span class="aa"><br />
<br />
<strong><u>WinRar / WinZip </u></strong><br />
RAR is the native format of WinRAR archiver. <br />
Like other archives, RAR files  are data containers,<br />
they store one or several files in the compressed form.<br />
After you downloaded RAR file from Internet,<br />
you need to  unpack its contents in order to use it.<strong><u><br />
<br />
CrackMe &amp; KeygenMe </u></strong><br />
A crackme (often abbreviated by cm) is a small <br />
program designed to test a programmers reverse<br />
engineering skills. <br />
They are programmed by other reversers to <br />
have a legal way to &quot;crack&quot; software. <br />
Crackmes, Reversemes and Keygenmes <br />
have similar protection schemes and  algorithms<br />
to those found in commercial protections.<br />
Also some crackmes  are even harder than <br />
their commercial counterparts. <br />
A Keygenme specifically is designed for the <br />
reverser to not only  find the algorithm used in <br />
the application, but also write a small <br />
Keygen in the programming language of their choice. <br />
Often anti-debugging and anti-disassemble <br />
routines are used to  confuse debuggers or make the<br />
disassembly useless. Code-obfuscation is  also <br />
used to make the reversing even harder. <br />
But most crackmes are hard by design, <br />
not by long obfuscated code.  Because most reversers<br />
solve crackmes for fun! <br />
That's the reason why  most reversers define rules for their crackmes.<br />
<br />
<strong><u> Chiptune</u></strong><br />
A chiptune, or chip music, is music written in sound <br />
formats where all the sounds are synthesized in real<br />
time by a computer or video game console sound chip,<br />
instead of using sample-based synthesis <br />
(confusingly, another popular definition of <br />
a chiptune is a module using small, looped samples <br />
to emulate the sound of the aforementioned sound chips). <br />
<br />
<strong><u> Packer</u></strong><br />
Packers do simply as their name suggests,<br />
they 'pack' or 'compress'  a program much<br />
the same way a compressor like Pkzip<br />
does, packers<br />
then attach their own decryption /<br />
loading stub which 'unpacks'  the program before resuming<br />
execution normally at the programs  original entry <br />
point. Packed files have<br />
several main advantages,  firstly the physical file <br />
size is usually smaller, of some benefit  if<br />
you are marketing your product via Internet download,<br />
the second  benefit (perhaps the one we are more concerned with)<br />
is that packed  files are resistant to the casual <br />
JNZ--&gt;JMP type of cracker  since a target must be <br />
unpacked or rebuilt before it can be patched. <br />
Naturally these advantages come at a price, <br />
both run-time and  commercially. <br />
<br />
<u><strong>Patch</strong></u><br />
This is a little program that reverse the protection of <br />
the  target software. Patches are often named:<br />
&quot;crack.exe&quot;, &quot;patch.exe&quot;,  &quot;softwarename_patch.exe&quot; <br />
or &quot;teamname.exe&quot;. <br />
The patch aims to the main *.EXE of  the target <br />
software or to a *.DLL. You should know that the<br />
patch have to be  applied to the exact software<br />
version it have been created for.<br />
The patch,  generally will force you <br />
to apply it to the file it aims.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Tutorial</strong></u><br />
A tutorial is one method of transferring knowledge and may be used as a part of learning.<br />
More interactive and specific than a book or a lecture; <br />
a tutorial seeks to teach by example and supply the information to complete a certain task.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Sources</strong></u><br />
They are very useful for beginner crackers, who don't know how to write  their first crack or keygen. <br />
Crack generators make big exe files, so  better way is to learn programming <br />
and create own small programs.
