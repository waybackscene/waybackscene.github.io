        		    Here we are: Year 2000. <b>CORE</b> (<i>Challenge of Reverse Engineering</i>) has become
			    the most successful and legendary international Cracking group ever.
                            Since the start of CORE in June 1997 we produced within 3 years over 6000 high quality cracks for 
                            computer software based on the Microsoft (TM) DOS/Windows Operating System. Our crackers are famous all over the world and showed thousands of commercial programmers
      			    the weak points in software-protections.  
                            
			    <p>
			    While our members search always for the ultimate cracking challenge the end-users of
                            software love <b>CORE</b> for sharing its quality cracks since years with everyone for free. 
			    On the other hand it's understandable that commercial software authors don't like us very much,
			    since we provide their potential customers registrations for free that they want to sell. 
			    However our idea is that everyone should be able to use a program if he needs to use it. A lot
			    of our crack-users can't afford expensive registrations since they live in countries where a registration fee 
                            is a complete monthly income or they're pupils/students. We don't want to make the world better. We don't think
			    that all software should be free. We know that we may hurt some shareware authors. We're not little kids that don't know what they do.<p> 

                            Our members seek for knowledge and challenge and on this way we provide people the results of our work for free.
                            We do not sell our cracks nor do we crack for money (believe me - we got a lot of offers from well known software companies). We're aware of large "Core Crack" Compilations in east-block
			    states that can be bought on the black market. This abuse of our work doesn't get supported by CORE in any way. 
    			    <b>CORE</b> is a total non-profit organisation. Please do not buy such CD's. If you need a Crack please use one of the large free collections 
                            of our Cracks on the internet (e.g. Hambo's Keygen Studio; all "commercial stuff" you will see there are banners that keep the site alive because it causes a huge load of bandwith).
                            <p>
	 		    If you have the money to afford a legal registration of your favorite program<br><b> -please-</b> think about it
       			    before you use one of our cracks. If you like a program and you can afford the registration fee then support
			    the author by buying a legal registration. Authors can only continue on coding future versions of their program
 			    when it's a commercial success. So wait a moment and think about it, before you get your free registration from 
			    a <b>CORE</b> Keymaker. Keep good software alive. Thank you.<p>
