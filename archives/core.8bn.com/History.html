                            When I took over CORE in June 1997 it was a terrible mess. The group was
                            founded in early 1997 by 4 persons. An official courier group called "perplex"
                            couriered the CORE releases to scene sites  without any dupechecks or
                            coordination. When I joined CORE on 06/22/1997 my first act as new Leader was 
                            to kick 60% of the members out of CORE. I disbanded the Council and my word became
                            law for CORE's members. After my position as leader was established I build up a complex release
                            system with a lot of rules during the first months. Later on one of our great script
                            coders translated my ideas into a perfect running automatic robot release-system
                            which is very famous in the so called "Warez" scene. <p>

                            The secret of CORE's glory is the hard work and hunger for knowledge of our core/original 
                            crackers. They will always have a place in our hearts and memories since they build CORE up with
                            me from nothing. Without them CORE would have never reached the top of the cracking scene. Most of them quit
                            the scene for good but they will be always remembered in the scene's hall of fame.<p>

 			    CORE has become the most successful and respected cracking group ever. We broke even UCF's
			    untouched glory after a lot of hard work. I love to say that CORE produced
                            over 4000+ quality keymakers for software protections. CORE features an automatic release 
                            system that dupechecks, packages and couriers its releases to CORE's scene HQs. 
                            We offer since over 1 year our work to the public via WWW and Hambo's Keygen studio gets
                            over 10.000+ hits per day.<p>

                            A lot of crackers joined CORE and their fame will always shine, even if some
                            of them had to return to real-life. CORE accepts only the finest crackers and features 
                            strict crack-quality rules. No other group in the scene released so many keymakers for
                            so called "uncrackable" programs like CORE!
                            <p>
                            CORE does support its crackers a lot. The crackers have to care about nothing
                            except the process of cracking. They can fully concentrate on cracking. If they
                            get stuck while cracking, old-school members can help them often out easily. CORE
                            has become a big friendly cracking family and I'm proud to tell you that my
                            old dream of forming the perfect cracking machine has become true! A lot of groups
			    ripped our work, a lot of groups tried to copy our style of releasing <b>- but -</b> they never
			    reached the "CORE" quality! 
                            <p>
			    Also CORE opened in the last 2 years several sub-divisions like COREUTiL and COREPDA. While COREUTiL
			    frustrated some old school util groups by beating them in some major releases, COREPDA dominates the PDA cracking scene with quality cracks for 3COM's Palmpilot. 
                            CORE reached in all sections of the scene all it ever wanted to reach. <p>

                            I hope CORE will keep up its good work for a long time. New respected crackers will join our
                            force for sure! We shout out a big "thank you" to all our hardcore fans that supported us all the time!
