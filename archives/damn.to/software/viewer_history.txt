DAMN NFO Viewer v2.10 History

[A number in parentheses stands for the build the bug was first reported for]

Version 2.10 build 31 RC 3   [Sep 12, 2002]
- Heh... frankly I completely forgot all the modifications I've made, but
  I guess there were some... bug fixes mostly ;)

Version 2.10 build 29 RC 2   [Oct 10, 2001]
- Finished Plug-ins support. Currently I really don't know what except release verification
  they can be useful for, but the one for DAMN releases is ready ;)
- Added uninstaller
- Changed some icons
- Fixed some Unicode compatibility issues

Version 2.10 build 27 RC 1   [Oct  5, 2001]
- Added language: Chinese Simplified (thanks to Laofuzihere)
- Added Unicode version of the program, which is automatically installed instead of
  the ANSI one in case your OS supports Unicode (WinNT/Win2k/WinXP). Unicode version
  is better ;)
- During installation you can now choose interface languages you want to be installed
- Message boxes now display Windows XP icons.
- Removed file:// hyperlink detection (just in case)
- Added 'TranslationAuthor' value to language dlls' version information
- Some internal tweaking (performance mostly)

Version 2.10 build 25 BETA 6 [Sep 27, 2001]
- Fixed the bug that made hyperlinks appear at wrong positions (24)
- Added ReadMe.txt with some useful information inside ;)

Version 2.10 build 24 BETA 5 [Sep 23, 2001]
- Added language: Dutch (thanks to Silver Premium)
- Pressing ESC key now quits the application
- Dropped PFTW, now using own installer
- Caret is now hidden when Direct Scrolling is on
- Fixed: random symbols would appear beyond the end of text sometimes (20)
- The Viewer now correctly displays files with doubled (e.g. because of 
  improper multiple ascii <-> binary conversions) line feeds
- Some localized versions of Windows 2000 (as well as Windows XP) have been
  naughty again! They have proved themselves able of replacing the glyphs
  even in raster fonts :/ So, with no decent words left for Microsoft
  programmers I had to switch to using raw bitmap routines instead of fonts.

Version 2.10 build 20 BETA 4 [Aug 19, 2001]
- Added smart email addresses detection ;)

Version 2.10 build 19 BETA 3 [Aug 18, 2001]
- Added language: German  (thanks to bloodfragger)
- Added language: Turkish (thanks to |CARTMAN-eXP|)
- File Drag&Drop is back
- Fixed: window would get scrolled when the caret was in the right 
  part of it (18)
- Fixed: last line of the file would be missed sometimes (18)

Version 2.10 build 18 BETA 2 [Jul 13, 2001]
- Added language: Italian   (thanks to zZoVutu)
- Added language: Norwegian (thanks to the--dud)

Version 2.10 build 17 BETA 1 [Jul  8, 2001]
- Added multiple language support
  - Added language: French  (thanks to Recca)
  - Added language: Russian (thanks to me ;)
- Added text wrap (no wrap/character wrap/word wrap)
- Added 3 raster fonts for displaying NFO files. They're based on Courier New,
  Lucida Console and Terminal typefaces. I also coded my own edit control.
  So I got rid of stupid Microsoft RichEdit control that fails miserably to
  display text with OEM fonts on some localized versions of Windows
  (i.e. Simplified Chinese)
- Improved Shell integration
- New window layout (it's now a frame window, not a dialog if this is of any
  meaning for you ;)
- Added toolbar
- Removed help file. It only was a waste of space, as most of the options are
  self-explanatory. Anyway, if you don't understand any of them, look at
  tooltips in Settings dialog.
  

Version 2.0.1          [Jan 16, 2001]
- Added 'Easy Scrolling' feature
- Added help file
- Fixed (heh, I hope so) bug with incorrect font under Windows 2000 (I had to
  add riched32.dll to the package, because Rich Edit Control v2.0 is unable
  to correctly display text with OEM charset font in some non-English
  Windows 2000 versions). [it turned out later that won't fix the prob]
- Improved hyperlinks detection
- Fixed really rare bug that caused incorrect processing of files with
  multiple \0 symbols inside
- Added some sort of setup =)

   - Underline hyperlinks option
   - Customizable hyperlinks color
   - Customizable hover color

   - Redesigned color pickers
   - Changed layout (it's now a property sheet)
 - Status bar now displays size of file being viewed
 - Starting up with File Open dialog can now be turned off
 - Fixed awkward status bar behaviour for file names with display width
   exceeding width of the status bar pane.
 - Fixed problem with window font sometimes getting back to system default.
 - Added EULA
 - Added history.txt
 - Old bugs fixed
 - New ones coded (uhm... probably =)
