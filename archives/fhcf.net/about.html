<br>
Flying Horse Cracking Force, the skilled elite that sends shivers down programmer's spine.<br>
But seriously, what is this FHCF all about?<br>
Well, way back in the day (in other words: 1999), some handsome chum by the name of Potsmoke founded a norwegian cracking group called (surprise): <b>Flying Horse Cracking Force.</b><br>
At first, Pot &amp; the gang tried to gather some norwegian members for their brand new group, but it turned out to be
quite hard, considering the small amount of norwegians in the world (there's about 4.5 million of us).
The first FHCF release hit the internet at the end of 1999. FHCF released a crack for Deluxe Ski Jump v1.50, and ever since that day, FHCF have been delivering cracks at stable speeds (we're like Linux kernel).<br>
<br>
Like every group out there, members come and go, and FHCF is no exception. Today the FHCF consist of mainly <b><a href="members.html">these members</a></b>.<br>
Getting technical for a minute:<br>
FHCF mainly reverse engineers win32 applications, produce gamehacks/trainers, and we even cracked some PDA software. As you can see, we've got our hands full, and we're not settling down yet.<br>
<br>
Now, about the name...<br>
Unlike many other groups with some SKiLLED ELiTE funky chicken name, FHCF 'stole' the name of a <b><a href="http://www.flyinghorse.de/" target="_blank">energydrink</b></a>. And since the norwegian government blows, we can't buy the fresh juice in Norway. They're making us cross borders and become fearsome pirates, smugling away! No, seriously, the main aim is that our name comes from a can of energy flavoured liquids.<br>
But it's not just the name that makes FHCF 'special' (no, we're not retards), it's the shared "hatred" we have against the 0day/Warez scene. FHCF cracks because knowledge is FUN (and King), not because we want access to the latest and greatest FTP's and shit like that. But hey, whatever floats your boat.<br><br>
FHCF accepts requests (free of charge of course, but we don't want any requests at the moment, sorry). Not many groups does that, we try to help you if we can, and in other words: We are layback software sugarpimps who share a passion for knowledge ;-). It's only possible to request NORWEGIAN software at the moment, we won't promise anything though<br>
We consist of people in 'all' ages, from 18 to 30, and we all share the same dream: To make FHCF the best norwegian cracking group ever, and we believe that dream has come true with us passing 1000 releases.<br>
We didn't start ELiTE, the members were freshmen with a demo of HIEW and a few patching tricks up their sleeve, but now we have months where we ship out 100 releases and 50% of them are keygens coded in win32asm.<br>
We are proud of what we have accomplished, and we are here to stay, we are<br><br>
