                        <p class="meta">We are back online</p>

                        <p>After a long delay, our website is back online. We are willing to continue cracking as many softwares as we can.</p>

                        <blockquote><p>Our philosophy is to make anyone to full test a software before buying it. Using the soft longer than the trial time is illegal, we take no responsability of any misuse of our release(s).</p></blockquote>

                        <p>All our releases are intended for educational purposes only. If you like a software buy it, this way the author will continue developing it and make it even better in the future.</p>

                        <p>FOFF's releases are free from adware, spyware, malware as any other team releases of course. However we have found that some crack hoster sites include in the package of the crack some adware named :crack.exe: None of our releases is named :crack.exe: Fortunatelly all of our releases are still on clean servers only.</p>


                        <h1>Greetings</h1>
