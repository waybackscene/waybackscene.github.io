Team GEAR - founded in 2006 - has devoted itself<br>
to high quality crack development.<br>
We admire the old school release teams and<br>
respect their activities in the past and today.<br>
Our philosophy is definitely the same.<br>
<br>
We are looking for talented crackers, coders, crack-tuners<br>
(tracker, composer), gfx'ers (designers) and helpers.<br>
You know the basics and you´re prepared to learn hard?<br>
You're welcome!<br>
If you wanna support or join us then feel free to contact us.<br>
<br>
Greets to RedSnake, Cyrone, FU86, Slyver, Redox and Gumbo. ;)<br>
