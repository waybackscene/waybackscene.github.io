<H1><A NAME="CRCV_001"></A>Chapter 6) Binary Arithmetic with No Carries</H1>
<P>Having dispensed with polynomials, we can focus on the real arithmetic issue, which is that all the arithmetic
performed during CRC calculations is performed in binary with no carries. Often this is called polynomial arithmetic,
but as I have declared the rest of this document a polynomial free zone, we'll have to call it CRC arithmetic instead.
As this arithmetic is a key part of CRC calculations, we'd better get used to it. Here we go:</P>
<P>Adding two numbers in CRC arithmetic is the same as adding numbers in ordinary binary arithmetic except there
is no carry. This means that each pair of corresponding bits determine the corresponding output bit without reference
to any other bit positions. For example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>        10011011
       +11001010
        --------
        01010001
        --------
</PRE>
<P>There are only four cases for each bit position:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   0+0=0
   0+1=1
   1+0=1
   1+1=0  (no carry)
</PRE>
<P>Subtraction is identical:</P>
<P>
<PRE>        10011011
       -11001010
        --------
        01010001
        --------
</PRE>
<P>with</P>
<P>
<PRE>   0-0=0
   0-1=1  (wraparound)
   1-0=1
   1-1=0
</PRE>
<P>In fact, both addition and subtraction in CRC arithmetic is equivalent to the XOR operation, and the XOR operation
is its own inverse. This effectively reduces the operations of the first level of power (addition, subtraction)
to a single operation that is its own inverse. This is a very convenient property of the arithmetic.</P>
<P>By collapsing of addition and subtraction, the arithmetic discards any notion of magnitude beyond the power
of its highest one bit. While it seems clear that 1010 is greater than 10, it is no longer the case that 1010 can
be considered to be greater than 1001. To see this, note that you can get from 1010 to 1001 by both adding and
subtracting the same quantity:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   1010 = 1010 + 0011
   1010 = 1010 - 0011
</PRE>
<P>This makes nonsense of any notion of order.</P>
<P>Having defined addition, we can move to multiplication and division. Multiplication is absolutely straightforward,
being the sum of the first number, shifted in accordance with the second number.</P>
<P>

     1101...
     -------
     1111111  Note: The sum uses CRC addition
     -------
</PRE>
<P>Division is a little messier as we need to know when &quot;a number goes into another number&quot;. To do this,
we invoke the weak definition of magnitude defined earlier: that X is greater than or equal to Y iff the position
of the highest 1 bit of X is the same or greater than the position of the highest 1 bit of Y. Here's a fully worked
division (nicked from [Tanenbaum81]).</P>

</PRE>
<P>That's really it. Before proceeding further, however, it's worth our while playing with this arithmetic a bit
to get used to it.</P>
<P>We've already played with addition and subtraction, noticing that they are the same thing. Here, though, we
should note that in this arithmetic A+0=A and A-0=A. This obvious property is very useful later.</P>
<P>In dealing with CRC multiplication and division, it's worth getting a feel for the concepts of MULTIPLE and
DIVISIBLE.</P>
<P>If a number A is a multiple of B then what this means in CRC arithmetic is that it is possible to construct
A from zero by XORing in various shifts of B. For example, if A was 0111010110 and B was 11, we could construct
A from B as follows:</P>
<P>
<PRE>                  0111010110
                = .......11.
                + ....11....
                + ...11.....
                  .11.......
</PRE>
<P>However, if A is 0111010111, it is not possible to construct it out of various shifts of B (can you see why?
- see later) so it is said to be not divisible by B in CRC arithmetic.</P>
<P>Thus we see that CRC arithmetic is primarily about XORing particular values at various shifting offsets.</P>

<H1><A NAME="CRCV_002"></A>Chapter 7) A Fully Worked Example</H1>
<P>Having defined CRC arithmetic, we can now frame a CRC calculation as simply a division, because that's all it
is! This section fills in the details and gives an example.</P>
<P>To perform a CRC calculation, we need to choose a divisor. In maths marketing speak the divisor is called the
&quot;generator polynomial&quot; or simply the &quot;polynomial&quot;, and is a key parameter of any CRC algorithm.
It would probably be more friendly to call the divisor something else, but the poly talk is so deeply ingrained
in the field that it would now be confusing to avoid it. As a compromise, we will refer to the CRC polynomial as
the &quot;poly&quot;. Just think of this number as a sort of parrot. &quot;Hello poly!&quot;</P>
<P>You can choose any poly and come up with a CRC algorithm. However, some polys are better than others, and so
it is wise to stick with the tried an tested ones. A later section addresses this issue.</P>
<P>The width (position of the highest 1 bit) of the poly is very important as it dominates the whole calculation.
Typically, widths of 16 or 32 are chosen so as to simplify implementation on modern computers. The width of a poly
is the actual bit position of the highest bit. For example, the width of 10011 is 4, not 5. For the purposes of
example, we will chose a poly of 10011 (of width W of 4).</P>
<P>Having chosen a poly, we can proceed with the calculation. This is simply a division (in CRC arithmetic) of
the message by the poly. The only trick is that W zero bits are appended to the message before the CRC is calculated.
Thus we have:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Original message                : 1101011011
   Poly                            :      10011
   Message after appending W zeros : 11010110110000
</PRE>
<P>Now we simply divide the augmented message by the poly using CRC arithmetic. This is the same division as before:</P>
<P>
<PRE>            1100001010 = Quotient (nobody cares about the quotient)
       _______________

                  1110 = Remainder = THE CHECKSUM!!!!
</PRE>
<P>The division yields a quotient, which we throw away, and a remainder, which is the calculated checksum. This
ends the calculation.</P>
<P>Usually, the checksum is then appended to the message and the result transmitted. In this case the transmission
would be: 11010110111110.</P>
<P>At the other end, the receiver can do one of two things:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Separate the message and checksum. Calculate the checksum for the message (after appending W zeros) and compare
	the two checksums.
	<LI>Checksum the whole lot (without appending zeros) and see if it comes out as zero!
</OL>

<P>These two options are equivalent. However, in the next section, we will be assuming option b because it is marginally
mathematically cleaner.</P>
<P>A summary of the operation of the class of CRC algorithms:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Choose a width W, and a poly G (of width W).
	<LI>Append W zero bits to the message. Call this M'.
	<LI>Divide M' by G using CRC arithmetic. The remainder is the checksum.
</OL>

<P>That's all there is to it.</P>

<H1><A NAME="CRCV_003"></A>Chapter 8) Choosing A Poly</H1>
<P>Choosing a poly is somewhat of a black art and the reader is referred to [Tanenbaum81] (p.130-132) which has
a very clear discussion of this issue. This section merely aims to put the fear of death into anyone who so much
as toys with the idea of making up their own poly. If you don't care about why one poly might be better than another
and just want to find out about high-speed implementations, choose one of the arithmetically sound polys listed
at the end of this section and skip to the next section.</P>
<P>First note that the transmitted message T is a multiple of the poly. To see this, note that 1) the last W bits
of T is the remainder after dividing the augmented (by zeros remember) message by the poly, and 2) addition is
the same as subtraction so adding the remainder pushes the value up to the next multiple. Now note that if the
transmitted message is corrupted in transmission that we will receive T+E where E is an error vector (and + is
CRC addition (i.e. XOR)). Upon receipt of this message, the receiver divides T+E by G. As T mod G is 0, (T+E) mod
G = E mod G. Thus, the capacity of the poly we choose to catch particular kinds of errors will be determined by
the set of multiples of G, for any corruption E that is a multiple of G will be undetected. Our task then is to
find classes of G whose multiples look as little like the kind of line noise (that will be creating the corruptions)
as possible. So let's examine the kinds of line noise we can expect.</P>

<DL>
	<DT><STRONG>SINGLE BIT ERRORS</STRONG></DT>
	<DD>A single bit error means E=1000...0000. We can ensure that this class of error is always detected by making
	sure that G has at least two bits set to 1. Any multiple of G will be constructed using shifting and adding and
	it is impossible to construct a value with a single bit by shifting an adding a single value with more than one
	bit set, as the two end bits will always persist.
	<DT><STRONG>TWO-BIT ERRORS</STRONG></DT>
	<DD>To detect all errors of the form 100...000100...000 (i.e. E contains two 1 bits) choose a G that does not have
	multiples that are 11, 101, 1001, 10001, 100001, etc. It is not clear to me how one goes about doing this (I don't
	have the pure maths background), but Tanenbaum assures us that such G do exist, and cites G with 1 bits (15,14,1)
	turned on as an example of one G that won't divide anything less than 1...1 where ... is 32767 zeros.
	<DT><STRONG>ERRORS WITH AN ODD NUMBER OF BITS</STRONG></DT>
	<DD>We can catch all corruptions where E has an odd number of bits by choosing a G that has an even number of bits.
	To see this, note that 1) CRC multiplication is simply XORing a constant value into a register at various offsets,
	2) XORing is simply a bit-flip operation, and 3) if you XOR a value with an even number of bits into a register,
	the oddness of the number of 1 bits in the register remains invariant. Example: Starting with E=111, attempt to
	flip all three bits to zero by the repeated application of XORing in 11 at one of the two offsets (i.e. &quot;E=E
	XOR 011&quot; and &quot;E=E XOR 110&quot;) This is nearly isomorphic to the &quot;glass tumblers&quot; party puzzle
	where you challenge someone to flip three tumblers by the repeated application of the operation of flipping any
	two. Most of the popular CRC polys contain an even number of 1 bits. (Note: Tanenbaum states more specifically
	that all errors with an odd number of bits can be caught by making G a multiple of 11).
	<DT><STRONG>BURST ERRORS</STRONG></DT>
	<DD>A burst error looks like E=000...000111...11110000...00. That is, E consists of all zeros except for a run
	of 1s somewhere inside. This can be recast as E=(10000...00)(1111111...111) where there are z zeros in the LEFT
	part and n ones in the RIGHT part. To catch errors of this kind, we simply set the lowest bit of G to 1. Doing
	this ensures that LEFT cannot be a factor of G. Then, so long as G is wider than RIGHT, the error will be detected.
	See Tanenbaum for a clearer explanation of this; I'm a little fuzzy on this one. Note: Tanenbaum asserts that the
	probability of a burst of length greater than W getting through is (0.5)^W.
</DL>

<P>That concludes the section on the fine art of selecting polys.</P>
<P>Some popular polys are:</P>

<PRE>16 bits: (16,12,5,0)                              [X25 standard]
