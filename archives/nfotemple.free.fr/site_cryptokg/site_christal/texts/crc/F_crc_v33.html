<H1><A NAME="CRCV_001"></A>Chapter 9) A Straightforward CRC Implementation</H1>
<P>That's the end of the theory; now we turn to implementations. To start with, we examine an absolutely straight-down-the-middle
boring straightforward low-speed implementation that doesn't use any speed tricks at all. We'll then transform
that program progessively until we end up with the compact table-driven code we all know and love and which some
of us would like to understand.</P>
<P>To implement a CRC algorithm all we have to do is implement CRC division. There are two reasons why we cannot
simply use the divide instruction of whatever machine we are on. The first is that we have to do the divide in
CRC arithmetic. The second is that the dividend might be ten megabytes long, and todays processors do not have
registers that big.</P>
<P>So to implement CRC division, we have to feed the message through a division register. At this point, we have
to be absolutely precise about the message data. In all the following examples the message will be considered to
be a stream of bytes (each of 8 bits) with bit 7 of each byte being considered to be the most significant bit (MSB).
The bit stream formed from these bytes will be the bit stream with the MSB (bit 7) of the first byte first, going
down to bit 0 of the first byte, and then the MSB of the second byte and so on.</P>
<P>With this in mind, we can sketch an implementation of the CRC division. For the purposes of example, consider
a poly with W=4 and the poly=10111. Then, the perform the division, we need to use a 4-bit register:</P>
<P>
<PRE>            3   2   1   0   Bits
          +---+---+---+---+
 Pop! &lt;-- |   |   |   |   | &lt;----- Augmented message
          +---+---+---+---+

       1    0   1   1   1   = The Poly
</PRE>
<P>(Reminder: The augmented message is the message followed by W zero bits.)</P>
<P>To perform the division perform the following:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Load the register with zero bits.
   Augment the message by appending W zero bits to the end of it.
   While (more message bits)
      Begin
      Shift the register left by one bit, reading the next bit of the
         augmented message into register bit position 0.
      If (a 1 bit popped out of the register during step 3)
         Register = Register XOR Poly.
      End
   The register now contains the remainder.
</PRE>
<P>(Note: In practice, the IF condition can be tested by testing the top bit of R before performing the shift.)</P>
<P>We will call this algorithm &quot;SIMPLE&quot;.</P>
<P>This might look a bit messy, but all we are really doing is &quot;subtracting&quot; various powers (i.e. shiftings)
of the poly from the message until there is nothing left but the remainder. Study the manual examples of long division
if you don't understand this.</P>
<P>It should be clear that the above algorithm will work for any width W.</P>
<P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<H1><A NAME="CRCV_002"></A>Chapter 10) A Table-Driven Implementation</H1>
<P>The SIMPLE algorithm above is a good starting point because it corresponds directly to the theory presented
so far, and because it is so SIMPLE. However, because it operates at the bit level, it is rather awkward to code
(even in C), and inefficient to execute (it has to loop once for each bit). To speed it up, we need to find a way
to enable the algorithm to process the message in units larger than one bit. Candidate quantities are nibbles (4
bits), bytes (8 bits), words (16 bits) and longwords (32 bits) and higher if we can achieve it. Of these, 4 bits
is best avoided because it does not correspond to a byte boundary. At the very least, any speedup should allow
us to operate at byte boundaries, and in fact most of the table driven algorithms operate a byte at a time.</P>
<P>For the purposes of discussion, let us switch from a 4-bit poly to a 32-bit one. Our register looks much the
same, except the boxes represent bytes instead of bits, and the Poly is 33 bits (one implicit 1 bit at the top
and 32 &quot;active&quot; bits) (W=32).</P>
<P>
<PRE>             3    2    1    0   Bytes
          +----+----+----+----+
 Pop! &lt;-- |    |    |    |    | &lt;----- Augmented message
          +----+----+----+----+

         1&lt;------32 bits------&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The SIMPLE algorithm is still applicable. Let us examine what it does. Imagine that the SIMPLE algorithm is
in full swing and consider the top 8 bits of the 32-bit register (byte 3) to have the values:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   t7 t6 t5 t4 t3 t2 t1 t0
</PRE>
<P>In the next iteration of SIMPLE, t7 will determine whether the Poly will be XORed into the entire register.
If t7=1, this will happen, otherwise it will not. Suppose that the top 8 bits of the poly are g7 g6.. g0, then
after the next iteration, the top byte will be:</P>
<P>
<PRE>        t6 t5 t4 t3 t2 t1 t0 ??
+ t7 * (g7 g6 g5 g4 g3 g2 g1 g0)    [Reminder: + is XOR]
</PRE>
<P>The NEW top bit (that will control what happens in the next iteration) now has the value t6 + t7*g7. The important
thing to notice here is that from an informational point of view, all the information required to calculate the
NEW top bit was present in the top TWO bits of the original top byte. Similarly, the NEXT top bit can be calculated
in advance SOLELY from the top THREE bits t7, t6, and t5. In fact, in general, the value of the top bit in the
register in k iterations can be calculated from the top k bits of the register. Let us take this for granted for
a moment.</P>
<P>Consider for a moment that we use the top 8 bits of the register to calculate the value of the top bit of the
register during the next 8 iterations. Suppose that we drive the next 8 iterations using the calculated values
(which we could perhaps store in a single byte register and shift out to pick off each bit). Then we note three
things:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The top byte of the register now doesn't matter. No matter how many times and at what offset the poly is XORed
	to the top 8 bits, they will all be shifted out the right hand side during the next 8 iterations anyway.
	<LI>The remaining bits will be shifted left one position and the rightmost byte of the register will be shifted
	in the next byte
</UL>

<P>AND</P>

<UL>
	<LI>While all this is going on, the register will be subjected to a series of XOR's in accordance with the bits
	of the pre-calculated control byte.
</UL>

<P>Now consider the effect of XORing in a constant value at various offsets to a register. For example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>       0100010  Register
       ...0110  XOR this
       ..0110.  XOR this
       0110...  XOR this
       -------
       0011000
       -------
</PRE>
<P>The point of this is that you can XOR constant values into a register to your heart's delight, and in the end,
there will exist a value which when XORed in with the original register will have the same effect as all the other
XORs.</P>
<P>Perhaps you can see the solution now. Putting all the pieces together we have an algorithm that goes like this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   While (augmented message is not exhausted)
      Begin
      Examine the top byte of the register
      Calculate the control byte from the top byte of the register
      Sum all the Polys at various offsets that are to be XORed into
         the register in accordance with the control byte
      Shift the register left by one byte, reading a new message byte
         into the rightmost byte of the register
      XOR the summed polys to the register
      End
</PRE>
<P>As it stands this is not much better than the SIMPLE algorithm. However, it turns out that most of the calculation
can be precomputed and assembled into a table. As a result, the above algorithm can be reduced to:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   While (augmented message is not exhaused)
      Begin
      Top = top_byte(Register);
      Register = (Register &lt;&lt; 24) | next_augmessage_byte;
      Register = Register XOR precomputed_table[Top];
      End
</PRE>
<P>There! If you understand this, you've grasped the main idea of table-driven CRC algorithms. The above is a very
efficient algorithm requiring just a shift, and OR, an XOR, and a table lookup per byte. Graphically, it looks
like this:</P>

<P>In C, the algorithm main loop looks like this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   r=0;
   while (len--)
     {
      byte t = (r &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF;
      r = (r &lt;&lt; 8) | *++;
      r^=table[t];
     }
</PRE>
<P>where len is the length of the augmented message in bytes, p points to the augmented message, r is the register,
t is a temporary, and table is the computed table. This code can be made even more unreadable as follows:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   r=0;
   while (len--)
          r = ((r &lt;&lt; 8) | *++) ^ t[(r &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF];
</PRE>
<P>This is a very clean, efficient loop, although not a very obvious one to the casual observer not versed in CRC
theory. We will call this the TABLE algorithm.</P>
<P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<H1><A NAME="CRCV_003"></A>Chapter 11) A Slightly Mangled Table-Driven Implementation</H1>
<P>Despite the terse beauty of the line</P>
<P>
<PRE>   r=0;
   while (len--)
          r = ((r &lt;&lt; 8) | *++) ^ t[(r &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF];
</PRE>
<P>those optimizing hackers couldn't leave it alone. The trouble, you see, is that this loop operates upon the
AUGMENTED message and in order to use this code, you have to append W/8 zero bytes to the end of the message before
pointing p at it. Depending on the run-time environment, this may or may not be a problem; if the block of data
was handed to us by some other code, it could be a BIG problem. One alternative is simply to append the following
line after the above loop, once for each zero byte:</P>
<P>
<PRE>      for (i=0; i&lt;W/4; i++)
           r = (r &lt;&lt; 8) ^ t[(r &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF];
</PRE>
<P>This looks like a sane enough solution to me. However, at the further expense of clarity (which, you must admit,
is already a pretty scare commodity in this code) we can reorganize this small loop further so as to avoid the
need to either augment the message with zero bytes, or to explicitly process zero bytes at the end as above. To
explain the optimization, we return to the processing diagram given earlier.</P>

<P>Now, note the following facts:</P>

<DL>

	<DD>The W/4 augmented zero bytes that appear at the end of the message will be pushed into the register from the
	right as all the other bytes are, but their values (0) will have no effect whatsoever on the register because 1)
	XORing with zero does not change the target byte, and 2) the four bytes are never propagated out the left side
	of the register where their zeroness might have some sort of influence. Thus, the sole function of the W/4 augmented
	zero bytes is to drive the calculation for another W/4 byte cycles so that the end of the REAL data passes all
	the way through the register.
	<DT><STRONG>HEAD</STRONG></DT>
	<DD>If the initial value of the register is zero, the first four iterations of the loop will have the sole effect
	of shifting in the first four bytes of the message from the right. This is because the first 32 control bits are
	all zero and so nothing is XORed into the register. Even if the initial value is not zero, the first 4 byte iterations
	of the algorithm will have the sole effect of shifting the first 4 bytes of the message into the register and then
	XORing them with some constant value (that is a function of the initial value of the register).
</DL>

<P>These facts, combined with the XOR property</P>
<P>
<PRE>   (A xor B) xor C = A xor (B xor C)
</PRE>
<P>mean that message bytes need not actually travel through the W/4 bytes of the register. Instead, they can be
XORed into the top byte just before it is used to index the lookup table. This leads to the following modified
version of the algorithm.</P>

<P>Note: The initial register value for this algorithm must be the initial value of the register for the previous

<P>This is an IDENTICAL algorithm and will yield IDENTICAL results. The C code looks something like this:</P>

</PRE>
<P>and THIS is the code that you are likely to find inside current table-driven CRC implementations. Some FF masks
might have to be ANDed in here and there for portability's sake, but basically, the above loop is IT. We will call
this the DIRECT TABLE ALGORITHM.</P>
<P>During the process of trying to understand all this stuff, I managed to derive the SIMPLE algorithm and the
table-driven version derived from that. However, when I compared my code with the code found in real-implementations,
I was totally bamboozled as to why the bytes were being XORed in at the wrong end of the register! It took quite
a while before I figured out that theirs and my algorithms were actually the same. Part of why I am writing this
document is that, while the link between division and my earlier table-driven code is vaguely apparent, any such
link is fairly well erased when you start pumping bytes in at the &quot;wrong end&quot; of the register. It looks
all wrong!</P>
<P>If you've got this far, you not only understand the theory, the practice, the optimized practice, but you also
understand the real code you are likely to run into. Could get any more complicated? Yes it can. <!-- Footer --></P>
