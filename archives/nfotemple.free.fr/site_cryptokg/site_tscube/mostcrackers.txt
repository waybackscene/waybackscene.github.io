Most crackers...
-----------------

# think they are coders just because they do crackmes

# think they are good in ASM just because they make offset patchers and keygens in ASM

# think they're "reversers" just because they know how to change a few bytes to crack a prog

# think it's funny to spend hours making keygens

# think process patchers are for lamers

# think VB is shit because it's hard to admit that anyone can make a prog using this langage

# think VC++ and C++ Builder is shit because they can't understand what OOP is

# think they know C++ just because they use 'cout' in their progs

# think Delphi is great because if it didn't exist, 90% of the "coders" would vanish

# think it's fair to spend 4 hours cracking a prog and then say the protection is lame

# think they are pretting good at making GUI using win32asm just because they use a template

# think everyone will want to read their last "replace jne with jmp" tut

# think 'inc eax,dec eax' is better that 'nop,nop' because most progs "count" the 'nop'

So, a typical cracker :
# is a coder
# is good in ASM
# spends his time making keygens
# don't use process patchers
# thinks VB, VC++ and C++ Builder is shit
# knows C++
# codes in Delphi
# thinks most protections are lame
# makes win32asm GUI progs
# writes very interesting tuts
# uses "inc eax,dec eax" instead of "nop,nop"

... by the way, are u a cracker ;) ?
