What's happening to <b>nGen</b>'s website?<br>
<br>
It's now <b>CLOSED</b>!<br>
<br>
Why? We'll explain that later. Come back soon.
<br><br>
Everything started in September 2001 when 2 french guys create the group "N-GeN". First, we were just a french group...<br>
But, when new members joined us during summer 2002, we did a huge step to become a global group.<br>
In september 2003, we were 2 years old and we reached the symbolic 1.000 releases barrier.<br>
<br>

But as you should know, serving files publicly isn't longer secure. That is why we decide to stop working on the website.
<br><br>
Members please meet up on irc.
<br><br>
So is <b>nGen</b> really closed? Our friends know.
