            WarezPuP Vb crackme 3 tutors by ACiD BuRN


ok , another vb crackme tutor from me , but this time it was a little
more funny coz the crackme used something against the cracker *g*
hehe
but you will see !!!


Tools needed : Soft-ice 3.x or 4
               Smart Check 6
               A brain :)


ok , i assume you have all this tools , so now lets Rock ! :)

*****************
****1st part*****
*****************


Run the crackm me to see the protection and you see a messagebox
saying you : "WarezPuP greets all those Crackers who try my third ..."
ok , press the OK button.
ugh ? another messagebox , saying you same shits :)
ok , press the ok Button and now , the crackme end :(
what the hell is that ? 1st i though it was a Sice detect so , i ran
Smart check on the crackme.
so , in Smart check you u run it , you see the 2 messages Boxes and it
end...
So in Smart check double click on +form1_load
well , scroll down until you see the text of the 1st message box.
just after all this shit of 'Chr$(integer:blabla)'. you see this :

MsgBox(VARIANT:String:"WarezPuP greets all those Cr..." <== this is the
1st messagebox , but we know it end after the second !!

ok , so let scroll down and we see :

Dir(VARIANT:String:"C\\WINDOWS\SMRTCHCK.TSF",FLAGS:00000000)

hmmm, what the hell is this ?? maybe the crackme look for this file
and end if it found it !!! hehe
ok , make a copy of this file with another name like SMRTCHCK.bak
and errase this one.
Now restart the crackme , u see the First Nag , but wait ... it run now
hehe , we kicked the 1st protection *g*
we can see a window with name / serial protection , hehe...


*****************
****2nd part*****
*****************

ok , now i will use Sice for this part coz i like this , but i succeed
in this task with Smart check too...
for this i will use a Search methode who works fine with some VB :)
hehe

before , read this :

so , the search in sice is : 
S 0 L ffffffff 56,57,8b,7c,24,10,8b,74,24,0c,8b,4c,24,14,33,c0,f3,66,a7

long to type so its a good to put this in winice.dat.
the Alt-F4 that is rarely used in your winice.dat file.so you can
use Alt-F4 as shortcut ! put this in the winice.dat
AF4="^s 0 l ffffffff 56,57,8b,7c,24,10,8b,74,24,0c,8b,4c,24,14,33,c0,f3,66,a7;"
This will save you the time of typing all that !! restart your computer now !


When it is done , we can start to crack this babe !

Enter this name and Serial :

Enter : ACiD BuRN
sERIAL: 11223344


ctrl+D to soft-ice and type bpx hmemcpy, press F5 and click on Ok and 
we are back at Soft-ice...
now press F11 and F12 untill you see Msvbvm50 at the down of the 
softice window.We are now at the good place , alt+F4 to search the 
compare emplacement !!
Now you should see "search pattern found at XXX:XXXXXXXX". for me 
XXX:XXXXXX is 25F:7B1DD9EA. Put a bpx on 25F:7B1DD9EA and disabled the
hmemcpy bpx ,type bd 0.

now press F11 and we break at 25F:7B1DD9EA .
it is where is the comparaison , We will see :


: 56 push esi
: 57 push edi
: 8B7C2410 mov edi, [esp + 10] ; Move real serial into edi
: 8B7C240C mov esi, [esp + 0C] ; Move fake serial into esi
: 8B4C2414 mov ecx, [esp + 14]

Press F10 to pass "mov edi, [esp + 10]" and type d edi for see the real
serial !

In data window , u must see : 
1.1.1.5.7.9.4.M.i.c.9.5.1.3.F.r.o.s.4.6.0.5.4.0.-.D.S.P

'cauz it is a vb proggy it is in wide format (space between digits).
to have the real serial remove the dots.
So, the real code is : 1115794Mic9513Fros460540-DSP

For check if it is the good one , we will enter:

nAME: ACiD BuRN 
cODE: 1115794Mic9513Fros460540-DSP

click on the Button and enjoy your Congratulations Messagebox :)
