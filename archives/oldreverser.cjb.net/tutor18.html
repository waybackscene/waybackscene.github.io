   How to crack Cracker World Crackme 1 cracked by ACiD BuRN


hello here :)
well this time , my tutor is for a Crackme written in ASM32
where : http://surf.to/crackmes   (E_Bliss site !! too cool)

Level : Medium (i wanted to say Easy , but not easy as some)


the protections are : - Anti Soft ice
		      - 2 Nags (one of them isn't normal)
		      - Name / Serial


              tools :  - Sice
                       - hex editor
                       - a little brain


For this tutor , i assume u know how to use Sice and how to put 
Bpx ...

1st part : Anti Sice

ok , Run the crackme , and u see the messagebox : Disable Sice
hehe , i am pretty sure , it is a lame meltice check...
Most of Sice check use the API createfileA..
so , in Sice, type : Bpx createfilea and press F5 to leave Sice...
Run the crackme again and u will be kicked back in Sice , great !!
Be sure , we are in the main exe , and not in window explorer !!
hehe , so u break in the crackme , now press F11.

In sice you are here now :

XXXX:XXXXXXXX    83F8FF  CMP EAX,-01  <=== little comparaison
XXXX:XXXXXXXX    7406    JZ  00400F7  <=== if EAX = -1 no sice , else Sice!
XXXX:XXXXXXXX    ...................

So , we will change the JZ tp JMP , like this , the crackme will
jum all time , like if Sice wasn't loaded :)
open the crackme with an hex editor (i use hexwork shop) and search
for this bytes : 83F8FF7406
u found them and replace them by : 83F8FFEB06
u need only to patch the 1st time you found this in the file !!
save it , and run the crackme...
COOL , no more Sice check , you see now a messagebox with : KiLL this
Fucking nag as text...
we will see this after , for now , i will do the Name / serial.
1st part CRACKED

**************************
*2nd Part : Name / serial*
**************************

ok , i will try the commom bpx for name / serial :
getwindowtexta and getdlgitemtexta.
bpx them , and press F5 to close sice.
name : ACiD BuRN
serial : 121212

Enter your name / serial and press on the check button...
Boom , we are kicked in Sice , so press F12 , u can trace little
but press F12 a second times instead of tracing with F10.
Now , We see this in memory :

XXXX:XXXXXXXX    CMP EAX,EDX   <== compare EAX to EDX
XXXX:XXXXXXXX    JNZ 0401453   <== if not equal jmp Bad cracker
XXXX:XXXXXXXX    JMP .......   <== if eax = edx , then jmp Good cracker
............................


So , to found the Good serial , u think :
D EAX to see the Fake code and
D EDX to see the Good code !!

eheh , Wrong answer !!
if you look in EAX , u see 6 (my serial length was 6 = 121212)
if you look in EDX , u see 80008300 (dunno where this shit come from)
so , it compare your serial length with 80008300 (it is hexa)
and if the length of your serial is equal to this , the crackme
jump to Good cracker message !!
80008300(h) = 2147517184(d)
Unless your are crazy !! you won't try to type one serial with this
length !!! so when u are at the CMP line in sice , type this:
R EAX EDX   <== this will copy in EAX the value of EDX
now trace with F10 the JNZ won't jump , and now u can press F5 to
look your Good cracker message !! : "Good Work"
hehe , so , u can enter the name u want , the serial must always
have a length of 8008300 in hexa !!
u can code a kind of keygen if you want , with random value , but 
sux , coz no calculations ...

2nd Part CRACKED !!!


***********************************
*3rd part : the EXit nag screen !!*
***********************************

ok , click on exit in menu or on the cross , and you will see a 
messagebox saying you : Kill this also , please confirm exit....
i will show kill it like a lazy man !! hehe , in summer , it is hot !
i will only put a bpx on messageboxa to kick this one...
so , in Sice : bpx messageboxa , press F5.
Click on Exit and u are kicked in Sice :)))
press F5 , and you will see the nag , clik on a button , no for exemple
and you are back in sice !!

you see this :

XXXX:004014E5  E8BD000000    Call User32!Messageboxa  <== call da bitch
XXXX:XXXXXXXX  ..........    CMP EAX,07   <== we are here !

ok , you see that the call at 4014E5 call this motherfucking Nag
so , in sice put a bpx on 4014E5.
disable the bpx messageboxa.
reclick on the quit menu or cross , and we are in Sice again at the
call place

now , type : 
A	{enter}
nop	{enter}
nop	{enter}
nop	{enter}
nop	{enter}
nop	{enter}
	{echap}
and press F5 , and you won't see any nag asking u to leave !!!
Great , we just have noped all the Call to the messagebox :))
now , with an hex editor , search this byte : E8BD000000 (original nag code)
and replace it with 5 nops !!!
save , run it again , and exit without seeing any NAG !!

3rd Part CRACKED !!


************************
*4th Part : the 1st nag*
************************


the 1st nag is a messagebox too , but not the same this time coz the
code , TeXskyman did something to hidde the call of the API..
So the way i explained you doesn't work, i did it , but i don't know
how to explain it really good but this worked .Maybe one cracker
will Give me another way , but i don't care for now , i kicked this 
fucking nag!!
when you run the crackme u see this text : "Kill this fucking nag"
ok , do a ascii search of this text with your hex editor.
now , i dunno how to explain but coz we can't see the call in memory
due to the hidded trick in this nag , i thought that the call will me
after this text , so , i did a search near the down and looked for
a : E8 (call start with E8 , not all but lot)
i found one , just under the message :)
ALL crackers know that a CALL = 5 byte in hexa , so nop it all , save 
your exe , and Run it...
CONGRATULATIONS !! no more nag at start !!!
you have now , a crackme without nags , and no problem with Sice !

4th part CRACKED !
