       How to crack EscapeRC v1.0.1 by ACiD BuRN [ECLiPSE/CiA]



Description : a VB5 Time_Limit!


tools used : - Wdasm89 (yes , i wanna have fun!)
             - hexeditor!




the essai :


As you can see , the tool used isn't Soft ice or Smart check , but Wdasm !!
In Vb app , you can't found string data refernces with the original version of wdasm :(
anyway , you can use the imports !!

So , run your target , after you moved your computer's date in 2002 for exemple...
Boom , you see a messagebox : Trial period is over , BLABLABLA....

ok , the VB apps don't use the API : messageboxa.
they use one similar : rtcmsgbox

So , in VB, for messagebox , you need to use : Bpx rtcmsgbox (for vb6 : bpx msvbvm60!rtcmsgbox)
ok , u can use soft ice , but in this essay i want to show that u can use Wdasm for
cracking VB...


Fire up , Wdasm , dessasm your target (EscapeRC.exe)...
goto imort and look for : rtcmsgbox
click 2 times , coz the 1st time is not important.
you will see this :

* Reference To: MSVBVM50.rtcMsgBox, Ord:0253h 
scroll up and you see :

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


So , you saw  : Referenced at 0041FA39
in Wdasm , menu goto , and choose Code location and enter : 0041FA39

you will land here :



* Referenced by a (U)nconditional or (C)onditional Jump at Address:
|:0041FA24(C)


:0041FA34 66837DEC1F              cmp word ptr [ebp-14], 001F  <== compare with 1F (31 in deci)

:0041FA4B 6810A04200              push 0042A010




now , u have just to patch it !!!
to be sure it works , i changed it to :

:0041FA34 66837DEC00         cmp word ptr [ebp-14], 00
:0041FA39 0F8445010000       je 0041FB84


hex edit your target and:
- search : 66837DEC1F and change it to : 66837DEC00.
- search : 0F8D45010000 and change it to : 0F8445010000 


save it , and run it !!
