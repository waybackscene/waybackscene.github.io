				Welcome to my 21th tutorial !!
                     How to keygen the Cracking4newies Crackme 3 project



Introduction:

Well , this is project to teach newbies cracking.It is the 3rd project , i didn't
look the others yet , coz i am damn busy...
Anyway , i take time to make one tutor , coz this will help newbies , who want to
learn keygening , and it is good for me to make keygens sometimes , hehe :)


Crackme notes from crackme's readme :

Objectives:          Explain how the serial number is generated ... and if
                     possible, code a KeyGEN for it.

i will add this :

Level : easy
coded by : ytc and Kwai Lo (thx friends , nice crackme !)



I)lets go !!


ok, now it is time to keygen this bitch , so in soft ice set your favorites BPX used
in name / serial cracking :
bpx getwindowtewta and getdlgitemtexta.

Enter your name and Fake serial.(name : ACiD BuRN /  Serial : 12345)
Click on enter , you are now back in Soft ice , press F12 coz you are not in the good
place , but in the lame user32 dll...
now , you can see , you are in the crackme. (i hope u understand all , i am tired as hell ;) )
trace with F10 , until u land here :


* Referenced by a (U)nconditional or (C)onditional Jump at Address:
|:004010C6(C)
|
:004010AF 0FBE4415C0              movsx eax, byte ptr [ebp+edx-40]   ; put in eax the 1st ascii 
value of you name (for ACiD BuRN :  A=41)

:004010B4 03F0                    add esi, eax                 /                  
:004010B6 8D7DC0                  lea edi, dword ptr [ebp-40] /   
:004010B9 83C9FF                  or ecx, FFFFFFFF           /               
:004010BC 33C0                    xor eax, eax              /               
:004010BE 42                      inc edx                  /        Loop                        
:004010BF F2                      repnz                   /
:004010C0 AE                      scasb                  /
:004010C1 F7D1                    not ecx               /
:004010C3 49                      dec ecx              /      
:004010C4 3BD1                    cmp edx, ecx        /            
:004010C6 76E7                    jbe 004010AF       /              



ok , so what does this loop ?! :

movsx eax, byte ptr [ebp+edx-40]  <==   eax = ascii value of the char at position EDX
add esi, eax                      <==   esi = esi + eax   
inc edx                           <==   next char
cmp edx, ecx                      <==   compare length of your name with the counter in edx
jbe 004010AF                      <==   If all chars are not done, loop until edx = length name


so , this loop just take each ascii value and add it in ESI.
the result for ACiD BuRN is : 2A8

41 + 43 + 69 + 44 + 20 + 42 + 75 + 52 + 4E = 2A8
A     C    i   D  space   B    u   R    N


After this loop , you land here :


:004010C8 897508                  mov dword ptr [ebp+08], esi  ; [ebp+8] contains ESI value
:004010CB C1650807                shl dword ptr [ebp+08], 07   ; [ebp+8] = shl [ebp+8],7
:004010CF 8D4DF4                  lea ecx, dword ptr [ebp-0C]  
:004010D2 6A0A                    push 0000000A
:004010D4 51                      push ecx
:004010D5 68E9030000              push 000003E9
:004010DA 53                      push ebx



As you can see , the esi value (for me : 2A8) is strored in [ebp+8].
then you see :   shl dword ptr [ebp+08], 07
really interesting ;)
well , we have to trace again..
Trace until you land here :


* Referenced by a (U)nconditional or (C)onditional Jump at Address:
|:004010E4(C)

:00401102 8D55F4                  lea edx, dword ptr [ebp-0C]
:00401105 52                      push edx
:00401106 E840010000              call 0040124B
:0040110B 8B4D08                  mov ecx, dword ptr [ebp+08] ; ECX = [ebp+8] ([ebp+8]= shl esi,7)
:0040110E 83C404                  add esp, 00000004
:00401111 03CE                    add ecx, esi                 ; ECX = ECX + ESI  (ESI=2A8 for me)
:00401113 3BC8                    cmp ecx, eax                 ; ? eax = fake serial / ? ecx = good
:00401115 6A00                    push 00000000
:00401117 751B                    jne 00401134                 ; if not equal jump lame cracker

Nice , now , i think you are able to make a keygen !!!
lemme show u all the algo :

1st part: Add all ascii value of your name and strore it in a variable.(ESI in memory)
2nd part: take the value in ESI and do a shl,7 on it and strore it in a variable.([ebp+8] in memory)
3rd part: take the value of the 1st part and add it to the 2nd part's value. 
4th part: take the result in decimal for serial :)

Name : ACiD BuRN
sERiAL : 87720

i gave you all to make your own keygen , but i will show u my source ;)
coz this tut is for newbies , well this is my delphi source...
i coded it very fast at 2 am , but works fine !


II) Delphi keygen sources:


procedure TForm1.Edit1Change(Sender: TObject);

var i,ascii,result: integer;

begin
	for i:=1 to length(edit1.text) do
begin

ascii:=ascii + ord(edit1.text[i]);
end;

asm
    mov eax,ascii
    mov ecx,ascii
    shl eax,7
    add eax,ecx
    mov ascii,eax
end;

result:=ascii;
edit2.text:=inttostr(result);
end;
end.


to make this work , u need to create a new project in delphi 4 and put this text box
edit1.text box = place to enter name
edit2.text box = final serial

click on edit1.text , in events , double click on "on change" and past this code !!
have Fun :)


III) Ending...

I want to thanx my friends ytc and kwai_lo for this cool crackme ;)
Well , this tut is finish , hope u understand all this piece of text , but if you have a 
comment or one question, mail me to : ACiD_BuRN@crackerinaction.org
Enjoy!
