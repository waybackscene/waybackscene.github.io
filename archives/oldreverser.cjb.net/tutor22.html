	VB keygening : ORDiX Mpack v1.X  by ACiD BuRN [ECLiPSE/CiA]




well...
i was lazy to make this tut , but it was requested by a friend so i will make it for
help him.


introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

this is my 1st VB keygening tut for a real app (not a crackme).
It is not hard at all , kinda easy i can say..
You will need : 

- Smart check 6
- a brain :)
- some Beer
- and this fucking ordix shit (see my ECL release to have it)

i assume u know how to configure smart check and how to use it...
don't come and bug me on IRC for this , i have others thing to do.
look for an essay for this , or something but i am too busy for answer on irc..
mail if there is a real prob..


Lets start :
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the file with smart check and run it...
in menu help , register enter :
- as name: ACiD BuRN 
- as code: 11223344

click on ok , and this fucker say u : invalid shit , blablababla...


anyway , end the programme , and go in smart check to look this bitch.
i am to lazy to write all this shit so , look the pic :

now , i will explain you the algo:

- 1st , u see in smart check your name.

- 2nd , the prog take this length:
in SC = Format(VARIANT:9,.....

- 3rd , then , u see this : len(NACiD BuR9)returns :10

so it take your name , take the last char of it (N for ACiD BuRN) and place it at first...
then take the len of your name and place it at last place... (9 coz length of ACiD BuRN = 9)

exemple : 

********************************
*     1st : Fuck you           *
*     2nd : uFuck yo           *
*     3rd : uFuck yo8          *
********************************

- 4th , take all ascii value in hex and add them as string (not addition)..

exemple : NACiD BuR9

N = 78 in decimal = 4E in hexa
result = 4E
A = 65 in decimal = 41 in hexa
result = 4E41
C = 67 in decimal = 43 in hexa
result = 4E4143
i = 105 in decimal = 69 in hexa
result = 4E414369
D = 68 in decimal = 44 in hexa
result = 4E41436944
" "= 32 in decimal = 20 in hexa
result = 4E4143694420
B = 66 in decimal = 42 in hexa
result = 4E414369442042
u = 117 in decimal = 75 in hexa
result = 4E41436944204275
R = 82 in decimal = 52 in hexa
result = 4E4143694420427552
9 = 57 in decimal = 39 in hexa
result = 4E414369442042755239


i hope u understand now !!

well , result is the correct serial :)
the serial length can't be more than 12 (u saw this when u enter your serial)
but if the length of the serial is > 9 , u need to take the hex ascii value of the 2 digits of 
the length.  (sorry for my lame english)
.

ACiD BuRN U          <--- length = 11


so : UACiD BuRN 3131    <-- 31 = hex value of ascii value 49 of the digit 1.

so the serial is : 5541436944204275524E203131

now , u have understand i think and i hope :)



i am lazy to code a keygen who work for name > 9 so , i will give you source for a keygen
in VB who work with 9 chars max as name :
i just coded it to show u , this source is not good coded , but i don't have time to make
it better ...
At least , it works !


---------------------------VB Source of the Keygen-------------------------------


Private Sub Command1_Click()
Text3.Text = ""
On Error GoTo sortie
checksum = Mid(Text1.Text, Len(Text1.Text))
dede = Asc(Mid$(Text1.Text, Len(Text1.Text)))
check2 = Len(Text1.Text)
code = checksum & Text1.Text & check2
Text2.Text = code
For x = 1 To Len(Text1.Text)
    bignum = Hex(Asc(Mid$(Text2.Text, x, 1)))
Text3.Text = Text3.Text & bignum
Next x
Last = Hex(Asc(Len(Text1.Text)))
final = Text3.Text & Last
Text3.Text = final
sortie:
Select Case Err.Number
Case 5
MsgBox "please enter your name !", vbOKOnly, Keygen
End Select

---------------------------END OF VB Source of the Keygen----------------------------


to make this source work , u need to put 3 text box and a button :

text1.text = where u enter the name
text2.text = hidden text box
text3.text = where u see the final serial


like i said earlier , this was coded fast , so don't bug me for lame coding...
if your not happy , FUCK YOU !


Well , this tut is finish , hope u understand all this piece of shit, but if you have a 
comment or one question, mail me to : ACiD_BuRN@CrackersInAction.org
Enjoy!
