How to "Pine" KingPin French version by ACiD BuRN [ECLiPSE / CiA]


note : i bet you are wondering what "pine" mean , heh it is french word , kinda equal to : fuck
it was just a word game , heh i am so bored ;)

Level : easy
protection : CD-Check
comment : Very cool Doom-like Game !!

tools needed : Wdasm 8.9
               Hex editor (i use hex workshop)


Intro:
~~~~~~
well , i just got this nice recent game , and on the cd , i found the crack , but
i hate using others ppls crack when i can do it my self !!
so , lets crack this Cool game !


1)Cracking part:

1st , install the game from a burned copy , and run the game.
you must see now the nice message : You must have the KingPin CD in the drive to play...
hehe , i love this =) , Fire up wdasm and open the game with it.
go in String data reference , and look for this phrase in it.
double click on it , and u don't see important things , so double click again on this
reference , and u must land here :


* Referenced by a CALL at Address:
|:0043D5F1                                                       <== hmm interesting =)
|
:00442030 56                      push esi
:00442031 E84AFFFFFF              call 00441F80
:00442036 8BF0                    mov esi, eax
:00442038 85F6                    test esi, esi
:0044203A 750E                    jne 0044204A

* Possible StringData Ref from Data Obj ->"You must have the KINGPIN CD in "
                                        ->"the drive to play."
                                  |
:0044203C 68C8414500              push 004541C8                   <== you land here !
:00442041 50                      push eax
:00442042 E859D7FDFF              call 0041F7A0
:00442047 83C408                  add esp, 00000008



so , we see the error message , and a little jne just before , but don't think like
newbie (don't try to reverse it with je) , but think a bit...
you see :

* Referenced by a CALL at Address:
|:0043D5F1 


So , lets see in wdasm the little call calling this shit :)
go in "Goto" menu , and click on "goto code location" and enter : 43D5F1
Now , you land here :


:0043D5E5 A184274900              mov eax, dword ptr [00492784]
:0043D5EA 83C40C                  add esp, 0000000C
:0043D5ED 85C0                    test eax, eax
:0043D5EF 7505                    jne 0043D5F6

* Referenced by a (U)nconditional or (C)onditional Jump at Address:
|:0043D5D2(U)

:0043D5F1 E83A4A0000              call 00442030           <== here !!!

* Referenced by a (U)nconditional or (C)onditional Jump at Addresses:
|:0043D51F(U), :0043D532(C), :0043D55A(U), :0043D5BA(C), :0043D5D0(C)

hehe , this call is the bitch who call the cd check , so why not noping it ??
click on this call , at the down of wdasm window , u must see offset : 3D5F1
so , fire up your hex editor , goto this offset and replace the : E83A4A0000
by : 9090909090
Now , save the file , and run the game...
choose new game shit , and WOW , the game is running !!
We made it , i said you , a recent game , but with a stupid protection , and very easy
to crack ;)
Lot of cd checks are lame like this , but if you find a file with ".icd" as extension
don't hope cracking it with this way , hehe !!
It is a cdilla bitch protected game..

this tut was very fast , but it is really easy , i think it doesn't need more explication
If you got a prob , ask me !

2)Ending....


Well , this tut is finish , hope u understand all this piece of shit, but if you have a 
comment or one question, mail me 
you can found all my tuts at :
