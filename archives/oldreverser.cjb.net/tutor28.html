How to keygen Lan-Box 1.01 by ACiD BuRN [ECLiPSE / CiA]


type: Visual Basic 6 app
level: very easy
tools needed: Smart check 6 , VB for coding the keygen
URL: http://members.tripod.com/LAN-BOX


1)Intro :

well , i am tired , i won't nag u lot in the intro ;)
it is a vb prog , i will show u how to keygen it ...
btw , A friend did a tut German tut too , i am sure it is good , but i
can't read read german heh...

2)time to go !

Fire up your smart check , and open this little shit ;)
click on Info button , and then on register
now , enter name : ACiD BuRN
and serial : 112233
click on the button to check serial , this bitch say us : bad serial blablabla...
heh , now end lan-box , in smart check do a search on this text : ACiD
you will land where the algo start!
now , look a bit , and you see it take ascii value from each letter of the name entered...
so , click on this line :

asc(String:"A") returns Integer:65 

To see what the heck this bitch does with ascii value , click on "show all event" in View menu..
now u see this :

asc(String:"A") returns Integer:65    now , you see the crackme taking ascii value of the current 
char (1st it is "A" from ACiD BuRN)
and then it add it to previous ascii value from others chars...

1st it add "65" to "0" coz no chars before "A" ...
in smart check you see this with this line :
__vbavaradd(VARIANT:Empty,VARIANT:Integer:65)

this add 65 to 0 (empty means : no value yet)

if you look down , you see same with the next chars of the name "C" (C from ACiD BuRN)
Asc(String("C") returns Integer: 67   <== take ascii value of the current char , here "C"
then add it to the last add of ascii value:

__vbavaradd(VARIANT:65,VARIANT:Integer:67)
then u see the result :
__vbavarmove(VARIANT:integer:132,VARIANT:Integer:65)
the result is : 132 , and the value:65 is the old result.So we can assume it replace 65 by the
new value : 132

Well it does this for each char ascii value  , so this loop take each char ascii value in decimal
from your name , and add them...

--------------------------------
A = 65 + 0
C = 67 + 65 = 132
i = 132 + 105 = 237
D = 237 + 68 = 305
space = 305 + 32 = 337
B = 337 + 66 = 403
u = 403 + 117 =  520
R = 520 + 82 = 602
N = 602 + 78 = 680
---------------------------------

so , the final value from this addition of ascii value is : 680 in decimal ....



Now , scroll down until the end of the loop on each ascii value of the name !
this is where u see the value '680' :)
heh , now look a bit , and scroll down until you see this :

__vbavarmul(VARIANT:680,VARIANT:232354) : this multiple the result of ascii value with 232354
the result of this multiplication is : 158000720

__vbavarmul(VARIANT:158000720,VARIANT:653435) : this multiple the result of 1st multiplication 
with 653435
the result is: 103243200473200

__vbavardiv(VARIANT:1.03243e014,VARIANT:23446534) : this divise the result of 2nd multiplication 
with 23446534 (note: 1.03243e014 is same than 103243200473200 , it is for this it is good to do 
calculs)...
the result is: 4403345.947558817 (u see this value in smart check)

and finaly you see :

__vbavarmove(VARIANT:Double:4.40335e+006,VARIANT:Integer:680) 
this move the final result (good serial) where the value "680" was written , it overwritte it!
so , 1st time , i though it was good serial , but it is now !!
i entered : 4403345.947558817 it sucked !!
bad serial msg box , and shit :-/
if we scroll down a bit you will see this value : 4403345,94755882
let's try it , IT WORKS !!
so , i was wondering how 4403345.947558817 become 4403345,94755882 , so i coded the keygen
to see how can i fix this prob...
i coded it in vb5 , entered : ACiD BuRN as name , and i genrated a serial with my keygen
and it give me : 4403345,94755882
Great !! , dunno why it works , maybe coz it is a vb apps , and the keygen is in vb too
but we don't care , it works ! i am tired , i don't want to think more!

Lemme explain the algo :


--------------------------ALGO---------------------------------

1st : add all ascii value of the name
2nd : multiply the value (of 1st part of algo) with 232354
3rd : multiply the value (of 2nd part of algo) with 653435
4th : divise the value (of 3rd part of algo) with 23446534

---------------------END OF ALGO-------------------------------

the result of 4th is the final serial !!




3)BONUS SOURCE OF THE KEYGEN IN VISUAL BASIC :



-----------------------------START OF SOURCE-----------------

For i = 1 To Len(Text1.Text)
temp = Asc(Mid(Text1.Text, i, 1))
final = final + temp
Next i
final = final * 232354
final = final * 653435
final = final / 23446534
Text2.Text = final

-----------------------------END OF SOURCE--------------------


to make this work , do a new project in VB , and put 2 text box and one button
text1.text = place to enter your name
text2.text = the serial will be shown there!
nothing more !
Enjoy !!


4)Ending....


Well , this tut is finish , hope u understand all this piece of shit, but if you have a 
comment or one question, mail me
