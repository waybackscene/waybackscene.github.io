Little description of Armadillo.You can see this on their official site:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Armadillo is a powerful software protection system. It wraps around your program like an
armored shell, defending your work from pirates and program crackers with state-of-the-art 
encryption, data compression, and other security features. It also allows you to add a 
complete software protection and registration-key system to your existing programs in five 
minutes or less, with no changes to your program's code! And it works with any language
that produces a 32-bit Windows EXE file.

.....


Armadillo modifies your program's EXE file, using a key you select and state-of-the-art 
compression and encryption tools to foil any attack relying on a decompiler -- all they can 
decompile is the code for the Armadillo decompressor itself, not your program. Your program 
is decrypted in memory when it is run, after Armadillo is satisfied that it's safe to do so 
and that the user has a valid license (more on licenses below). This, along with some advanced
 snoop-detection functions, prevents most patch/bypass attacks -- it would require far more 
knowledge (and a great deal more work) to patch your program while it's encrypted.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks nice :) (errr, looked hehehe coz i owned it :)


0) Introduction:


I was surfing on their website where we can download the shareware version of
Armadillo, and when i saw all possibles options of this shit , i told me that i should
have a closer look on it :)
So, after the installation , i took calc.exe ( in the windows dir) and i packed it using
standard options to look the beast ;) hehe




1) How to run a protected file with Soft-ice loaded:


Nowadays , commercial protections use anti sice tricks... Armadillo as well.
There is even 3 detections in it:

- 1st one is the well known meltice.(Createfila \\.\SICE, \\.\NTICE and \\.\SIWDEBUG)
- 2nd one is the IsDebuggerPresent tricks. the API getprocaddress is used...
- and the last one is a little INT 3h..


How to bypass these motherfuckin' tricks ?!

We need to run the packed file with the soft ice loader.So , load it with it and then
Run it...
Soft-ice must pop up and you prolly see some little: INVALID
At this time , put a BPX BPX Createfilea , press F5 3 times and you should arrive on the
check. it looks like that :


025F:10003895  FF1520A00010        CALL    [KERNEL32!CreateFileA]
025F:1000389B  83F8FF              CMP     EAX,-01
025F:1000389E  7409                JZ      100038A9   <-- here change it to JMP 100038A9
025F:100038A0  50                  PUSH    EAX
025F:100038A1  FF1538A00010        CALL    [KERNEL32!CloseHandle]
025F:100038A7  EB0B                JMP     100038B4
025F:100038A9  FF1544A00010        CALL    [KERNEL32!GetLastError]
025F:100038AF  83F802              CMP     EAX,02
025F:100038B2  7404                JZ      100038B8
025F:100038B4  C645FF01            MOV     BYTE PTR [EBP-01],01
025F:100038B8  8B4604              MOV     EAX,[ESI+04]



We need to change the JZ 100038A9 to JMP 100038A9.
For this, you just have to be at the good line in sice ( The JZ one...) and then under sice
you type:

A "press Enter"
JMP 100038A9 "press Enter"
"press Echap"

Goody , the jz became a JMP , now we gotta trace with F10 and we pass through the 
CALL  [KERNEL32!GetLastError] , After passing it , we see : CMP EAX,2.
If EAX is not equal to 2 then it is fucked! OK ...
Look in EAX and we have EAX = 2  So it's good :))
Press F5 , we see the same thing , CMP EAX,2.  EAX is still equal to 2 so lets continue...
Press F5, we see the same thing CMP EAX, 2 and EAX = 2 so it is OK too...
We press F5 for the last check, but this time when we are on CMP EAX,2 we can see EAX = 32
Hmm, if we don't fix it , it ain't going to work :-|
So , just put 2 in EAX and all will be good :)

Under Soft-ice, just type : R EAX 2
W00p EAX changed to 2. So the CMP EAX,2 will be good :) everything is OK :)

Once this shit is done , we gotta kill the 2nd Soft ice check 
It uses the GetProcAddress API, so set a BPX on it and press F5.
Just press F12 once to get out of the call and you should meet that piece of code ( or
something similar)


025F:XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXX        CALL    [KERNEL32!GetProcAddress]
025F:100038ED  3BC3                CMP     EAX,EBX
025F:100038EF  740A                JZ      100038FB   <--- DO un R FL Z
025F:100038F1  FFD0                CALL    EAX
025F:100038F3  85C0                TEST    EAX,EAX
025F:100038F5  7404                JZ      100038FB
025F:100038F7  C645FF01            MOV     BYTE PTR [EBP-01],01
025F:100038FB  56                  PUSH    ESI
025F:100038FC  FF1548A00010        CALL    [KERNEL32!FreeLibrary]


You prolly see CMP EAX,EBX and the conditional JMP just after it ...
Here we have to reverse the Zero Flag and the programme will work normaly !
To reverse the Zero Flag , you just have to type: R FL Z (under soft ice of course...)
once you are at the good line ( here it is : 025F:100038EF  740A     JZ      100038FB )
At this point of time , we have to trace with F10 like a fool and we gotta see the 
famous INT 3h coming ;)
But before, like the version of Armadillo i'm using is shareware , we will see a nag screen
telling us that we're using an unregistered version ... (hehe , for now :)
So click on OK and continue to trace ...

This nag is quite simple to overcome , we just have to put a RET in the call and it is done :) 
But we gotta kick out all the garbage putted by Armadillo , so we don't give a flying fuck about
it !
And it is done , Now we can Work with soft ice loaded and unpack the beast !
But i cannot prevent me to say a little remark



-------Remark:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like you prolly noticed , it is possible to protect exe with a name / serial 
at the start of the prog who can be boring to kick , 'cause we wanna run the prog in memory ...
I am telling you this 'cause the file we are studing doesn't contain name / serial
'cause we packed it using standards options!
But when i wanted to rip the nag off , i did a mistake and i patched the bad CALL!
I entered the wrong one , and put one RET on the PUSH EDI ( i think , well on the
1st instruction !)
Then , i came out of this call ( 'cause of the RET eheh ) and i traced with F10.
And then , guess what ? a motherfuckin' Dialog Box poped up ! asking me to enter the name serial
huhu ! what the fuck is that ? we didn't activate that crap, but just with a patch we can got
this screen !
Looks like whatever we do , the exe contains the part of code for the name / serial dialog !
Weird, but i conclude that must be quite easy to rip that dialog off! just a Call to play with!
and we got a standard packed exe!
Well , didn't have time to explore and study it much, but it can be intresting !
It's possible that i am saying bullshits hehe 'coz i didn't have a closer look yet ;)
Looks like every Commercial Protections ! STUPID :)

-------End of Remark:---------------------------------------------------------------------


So, let's finish our Work :)
We continue to trace with F10 until we see the INT 3h fucker !
After a bit , we see that:


025F:00402241  2401                AND     AL,01
025F:00402243  8885B8FEFFFF        MOV     [EBP-0148],AL
025F:00402249  BA6D447546          MOV     EDX,4675446D
025F:0040224E  8995B0FEFFFF        MOV     [EBP-0150],EDX
025F:00402254  C785C4FEFFFF260C3604MOV     DWORD PTR [EBP-013C],04360C26
025F:0040225E  895DFC              MOV     [EBP-04],EBX
025F:00402261  8B85C4FEFFFF        MOV     EAX,[EBP-013C]
025F:00402267  3385B0FEFFFF        XOR     EAX,[EBP-0150]
025F:0040226D  8BE8                MOV     EBP,EAX
025F:0040226F  B804000000          MOV     EAX,00000004
025F:00402274  CC                  INT     3                 <----- the Goddamn INT 3h :)
025F:00402275  3115148D4000        XOR     [00408D14],EDX
025F:0040227B  A180804000          MOV     EAX,[00408080]
025F:00402280  310584804000        XOR     [00408084],EAX
025F:00402286  834DFCFF            OR      DWORD PTR [EBP-04],-01
025F:0040228A  EB18                JMP     004022A4



the protection is really similar to the 1.73 one! Lads at Armadillo' society are lazy ass !
Didn't work lot for a protection told as "uncrackable" <---- LOL :)

In short , you prolly noticed the "MOV EAX, 00000004".
To bypass this check, you just have to put a JMP 0 instead of the MOV :)
In Soft-ice , type:
A "enter"
JMP 0 "enter"
"Echap"

Ok, we just changed mov eax,4 to jmp 0.
This will produce an exception and the programme will believe that Soft-ice isn't loaded!
and it will run Fine :) enjoy it hehe :)
We now have Calc.exe , ran with sice loaded , but it is still packed !


2) How to wipe Armadillo out of the protected EXE !


A) recover and dump what we need:

It is this part who pissed me the much , 'cause i got one dumb error when i was making
the new exe :( i restarted many times , and now look how i did:
btw, it is easy , i was doing something wrong , i think i need to sleep sometimes hehe :)
i was using the wrong section size ! of .text.   

So , you ran your prog and if you look in the directory where the exe is , you can see
one teporary file (heheheh !)
Copy it , this bitch will be needed later!
Then run procdump and look in the process list , you should see calc.exe and the
temporary file aswell!
Just do a right click on it (we wanna dump the TEMP file , not the exe..) and then you
have to do a full Dump...
We now have one new exe on the hard drive, it is the temp file dumped and we also got
one temp file ( the one we copied earlier)


B) How to make a working exe without that Goddamn Armadillo ;)

If you rename the temp file in one exe file , and then run it, it will crash to hell!
It is normal 'cause if you Hexedit it , you gotta see a lot of "XX"!
Looks like the 1st section is fucked up !
Hmm, let's run our Dump and this asshole crash too :-/

GogogadgetauProcdump lol , you understood , you have to run Procdump and then to use its 
PE editor on the Dump. you should see sections of the file , you have to look for the 1st 
of them ! 
I got this:

- For the ".text" section :


   Virtual Offset: 00001000 
         Raw Size: 11A0E
       Raw Offset: 1000


Ok, keep that on a paper , we will use them !
With Procdump  right click on this section (.text) and then : "saves to file" this will dump it
on your hard disk! (example: text.bin).We do this coz this section is completly GOOD !
No fuckin' "XX" in it !
the Temp file got XX.Hmm , in fact Armadillo re-writte the section in memory...
Once , the dumped section is on your disk , you hexedit your exe with Hexworkshop 
(the exe is the temp file , renamed..)
Open also the dumped section (aka text.bin in this example)

Now , in  Hexworkshop, press alt+f5, enter Raw offset of the section that you want import.
Here it is 1000 ( look above for the value).So enter 1000 and press OK...
Go in the Edit menu and click on "select block" and enter the length (size) of the section
Here it is : 11A0E...

Look the opened file (text.bin) , and press 'ctrl+a' to select all...
copy that with 'ctrl+c'.

go back in the main window ( exe one) in Hexworkshop (the temp file renamed...)
and paste the data you just copied (copied from text.bin).
'ctrl+v' or Edit menu and paste.

Save your file, and you now got a garbageless .text section ! and working :)
It doesn't contain "XX" anymore ! hehe
Run your saved executable and W00p :) , it is working ! IT RUNS !! IT RUNS lol :)

But , to be sure that the file gotta work on every OS version we can rebuild the PE
with procdump.

It is free , so what about doing it ?! :)

- Run Procdump (Thx G-RoM :)
Go in Options and select:

[X]Recompute Object Size
[X]Optmize PE Structure

[X] Use actual import infos

and click on OK

Click on Rebuild PE and open your saved file.
Procdump do for us one valid import table and our executable is now more trustable heh :)
Run it to see if it still works ..
It is ok , this bastard didn't crash ehehe !
Ok , the tutorial is over , and i hope you learnt something with it !
