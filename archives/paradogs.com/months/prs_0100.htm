            &gt;After their countless Japanese dupes, including some of which
            <br>
            &gt;were dupes of themselves, ACCESSION has screwed up yet another
            <br>
            &gt;Japanese title.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Seems as you still can't accept that <b>Accession</b> has beaten you on that game with a <b>working</b> crack!</p>

          <p>Too childish to face the truth???</p>

            &gt;While KALISTO was busy repacking and uploading a clean, cracked,
            <br>
             &gt; &amp; WORKING BIN/CUE of BioHazard Gun Survivor, ACCESSION was
            <br>
             &gt;bothering AVH/PARADOX to crack the game for them.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Yes</b>, I cracked it and made the patch without having the game, just with the plain EXE ... That's the only reason why PAL/NTSC selection is fucked up ... You kiddies will never be able to make a fucking BIN/ISO patch without the game CD ... Even when it is a simple <b>one byte</b> crack like this one...</p>

          <p><br>

          <blockquote>
            &gt;In the end though, this rushed out Crack done by AVH/PDX ended
            <br>
             &gt;up not working for a majority of people.

          <br>
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            &gt;The first fault would be that the Patch is supposed to have a
            <br>
             &gt;PAL/NTSC Selector built onto it, but however all it does is
            <br>
             &gt;show the intro in NTSC, there is no PAL Selector to make this
            <br>
             &gt;release anywhere near superior to ours.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Wrong</b>! You kiddies should learn to read scrollers ... Open your eyes and you'll notice a text like: "press X for PAL or O for NTSC" We know, most of you KALgimps still haven't finished school, so it's no wonder you can't read... :-)</p>

          <p><br>
          <br>
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            &gt;The second fault would be that this game CONSTANTLY freezes,
            <br>
             &gt;skips, and locks up throughout the game. This is what everyone has
            <br>
             &gt;been complaining about lately.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">I admit it, the game seems to crash sumtimes when u run it in PAL mode, but it works 100% in NTSC mode ... Simply press O in the intro and off you go...</p>

            &gt;It is really sad that other groups are constantly trying to team
            <br>
             &gt;up to compete with the professionals in KALISTO.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Wow, very professional to call a <b>one byte</b> crack superior... :-)</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">And when it comes to coding/cracking/patching you have not a single chance against the wizards in <b>Paradox</b> ...</p>

             &gt;else, they are unable to compete with us.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Heh, 'coz u're underaged we would <b>never ever</b> wanna have sex with you kiddies... And never forget <b>who</b> intoduced cracking/patching in PSX "scene": the dudes at <b>paradox</b> (mainly Freefall &amp; xor37h), no-one else ...

            &gt;Now we present you the WORKING Crack for BioHazard Gun Survivor.

             &gt;This has been tested on the ACCESSION release, The Original &amp;
            <br>
             &gt;It was the one used to make our Clean, Cracked Release.
