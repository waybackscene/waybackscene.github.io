G'day guys,
I have just downloaded a patch for &quot;Medal of Honour 2&quot; (pdx-moh2) 
and  unzipped the file. There were another three files in there, a 
text file  (which I read), but the other two files I'm not sure what 
to do with them or  how to open them. (file_id.diz) and 
(pdx-moh2.ppf) Could you tell me how to  use them or where I could 
find out how to use them.

Thanks,
&gt;From the stupid Australian (Snakey).      
      </pre>
      <p>Yeah, the text file can be read. Well done. I think the two other files are just crap and just have been included to make bigger files in order to get
      more credits when you up them on those notorious scene FTPs. Quite tricky those Paradox guys.</p>

Hi!
I saw on a forum (fileforums.com) that you, paradox, according 
to this  person have released a dc ripping tool, for usage with 
original gdroms, the file was said to have the name 
pdx_gdhack.rar1 and was protected with a password that hasent 
yet been broken

I, myself think this is bogus, but i just wanted to check with 
you guys, could this be true??

      <p>Hi. The moderator of fileforums.com asked me, the webmaster of Paradogs.Com, not to give you the correct password, to avoid that you, who'd like to
      have the correct password for the tool, could start to crack DC games yourself. But keep in mind that everything can become true. Use your imagination.</p>

lost about 5 eggs.

Just in case this was caused by something in the save on the memory card 
i wiped the Spyro 3 save from the memory card and start again. After about 
10% in went to thre fairy outside of the ballon and the fairy spoke about 
this being a hacked copy.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but i hope this helps you fix the patch.

Hello !
Well i was so happy to see one final and 100% Spyro 3 Patch for 
the Pal version. I copied teh game again, deleted my old save game 
and started a new one. But the fairy still tells me something about 
ilegal copy, and i cant find all gems in the levels. Also teh 
language switches in the swamp. Same as before. Am i crazy or did 
something wrong. I know how to patch games (well its not really 
difficult to apply a PPF patch).

Can you please tell me ?

I tried it on several Boards, but maybe some others arent playing the 
game so far, so nobody can't help me.

Hope to hear from you
Thanxs and greetings from Europe

      <p>Yes, you are crazy. Yes, you did something wrong. Is that what you expected to hear?<br>

Schönen Guten Tag,

bei meinen ersten Versuchen überhaupt, eine Sicherungskopie für die
Playstation zu erstellen habe ich mich an Parasite-Eve 2 Versucht.
Leider hat das nicht so hingehauen, kopieren kann ich nur 1:1 mit Nero 5.xx.
Was mache ich falsch? Inter0 (CD1) und Inter1 (CD2) läßt sich nicht &quot;normal&quot;
einlesen sodaß ich pdx-pe21.ppf nicht einfach anhängen kann da ich ja bei
einer 1:1 Kopie nur über eine Image-Datei auf der Festplatte Verfüge.

Meine original Silent Hill CD ist mir unwiederruflich verlorengegangen, und
ich möchte dies nicht nochmal erleben.

Über eine Antwort mit Hilfestellung wäre ich sehr dankbar!

Grüße aus Frankfurt,

      <p>I don't think it's possible to loose an original CD this way. Okay, I have never burned a CD-ROM nor do I own a CD-writer but making an image-file can <b>not</b>
      destroy or make you loose an original CD. Tell that your grandma. She might believe it.</p>

Hi there, I have used your spanish version of the patch with Hogs of

is loading sometimes it dont recognize the copy ( and shows  a cd 
with !), in adddition the sound dont works well too, and I dont know 
why!

I have patched Spyro3 with your spanish versio and when I try to play

when load the stage the TV turn black and nothing happens, can you help

note: I dont know what version of chip ia have, just that is a internal

Hi Guys !!!!!

So i tested your last patch for spyro III Pal and something 
strange happends!

1) In the first level, the message about the illegal copy from 
the little elf appears always in this game!
Is this correct or a bug???

2) In the level with the cat and the skate board, after you got 
the first egg, you try to catch the second one, you got only one 
time the skate board!!!! so to get it the second time, i have to 
leave and to reeenter the level !!!!!!!
I mean, this is not normal ?????

3) How to burn the copy ?!!?!?!!?
I tried with cdrwin and the option defect sectors replace, is this correct
?

Thanks for helping
PS: I'm very happy about you work ;O)

      <p>1) It is correct because the developers and distributors dislike you playing pirated copies.<br>

Hallo Paradogs Team,

ich habe mir den Patch für SPYRO 3 -YEAR OF THE DRAGON aus dem 
Netz gezogen, er funktioniert prima. Das Spiel ( PS ONE )  läuft 
einwandfrei, die drei Trainer sind in Ordnung.

JETZT MEIN PROBLEM: Als wir 63 % des Spieles geschaft haben, mußten 
wir in die MITTERNACHTS WELTEN wechsel. Wir wollten mit dem Ballon 
dorthin fliegen, als wir zu dem Bollon gingen mußten wir durch ein 
Tor. Dort wurden wir von einer ELFE empfangen, sie speicherte  den 
Spielstand auf MEMORY CARD. 

DANACH ERSCHIEN IN DER SPRECHBLASE FOLGENDER TEXT:
HI SPYRO, du spielst mit einer illegalen Raubkopie, dies kann Probleme 
verursachen. Dies Tat es auch. Einige EIER die wir gesammelt hatten in 
Bad Sonnenaufgang und weitere wurden gelöscht. BITTE ÜBERPRÜFT DIESES 
MAL.

BITTE UM RÜCKANTWORT

one change i hope to see is that there should be single patches

dragoon had trainers, pal-ntsc, and protection fix when i only 
wanted the p.f 

please fix this

Hi,

I have been booting thru your website for about 1 hour and I 
think it rocks.  I was looking for the patch for the FA Premier 
League Football Manager 2000.  I think you have it listed in the 
Releases section and I read the *.nfo file but I do not know how 
to get it.  
I am assuming I need this file because when I put the PAL game into 
my NTSC Playstation it looks like I need to adjust my vertical hold.  
The sounds comes out clear but the screen rolls continuously and 
flickers. I am new at the PSX patching as you can tell and any help 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Graeme      
      </pre>
      <p>Atleast you read the .NFO file. Well, if you can read it you shouldn't have problems to download the .NFO, too. Or save it manually.</p>

I live in the US, I chipped my console and rented Spyro 3 the game was 
terminated, I downloaded ppf o matic v2.0 and cdrwin I applied the patch but 
the game does not load. I followed the patching steps correctly, I backed up 
the game with no patch and it does the same as the original, the game is 
NTSC|U/C I also checked the bin file size and it is not of the exact same 
size. Did I get the right patch? The one I got is pdx-s3uf. Can you help me 
somehow?      
      </pre>
      <p>We can help you with a great advise: a game worth playing is a game worth buying. No problems with patches and bin file sizes will occur. The software
      industry will earn a few bucks, so they can pay the developers and invest money into new games. No games sold mean no money for the developers and no
      money for the distributors so finally there won't be money for new games. Remember a machine called Amiga?</p>

I have successfully burned this game adding the patch. 
Everything seems hunky dorry till you get the 3 hundred 
gems and go through to a different level.
The screen then goes blank and does no more.
Is this a protection thing or is the game i copied possibly 
scratched,even though the original works fine.
Any response would be appreciated.
By the way-i think the work you do is the bollox!

      <p>Yeah. This is a clear warning that you should use original software only. It's a sort of hardware protection from the mobile Sony unit. Each night when

      Now refering to your smart comment. Paradox, the original one (= <b>we</b>, not you Russian scum), was founded in 1990. 1990! When electricity got
      introduced in Russia. You remember?<br>
      Good. So we know now that you Russian scum have stolen the name 8 years <b>after</b> we have introduced it to the computer scene. 8 years later. Can you
      count until 8? Sure, it's our fault since we have got computers many years before you guys have had electricity. We have to apologize for it. We are not
