I tried the patch for coolboarders 2001 and while it did take 
away the protection it changed the game to a PAL format, I'm 
assuming this because now It has a constant roll, where the t.v. 
wont sync up..... the info file indicates to me that it is a NTSC patch.  
Also it is worded as a PAL/NTSC selector, can you select whether to 
patch as PAL or NTSC or not.

Thanks

hi folks!

your &quot;revised&quot; version is still not fully.workin' 
the 3+ trainer +pal /ntsc -switch works perfectly,but
when i want to use the &quot;balloon&quot;-part to get to antother
level, the savepoint-fairy tells me the following message.

&quot;hello spyro, it seem that youre playing a hacked copy [...]
 you may experience some problems during the game&quot;

or something like that. the game still detects that the 
current disc is not the original. how strange is that?? 
this is not a joke,this dialog-box really appears in the game.
the guys at &quot;insomniac&quot; sure know their stuff.

please update ya ppf-patch and release it as soon as possible.
keep up the good work,guys!

Hi I have a copy of the first version of Spyro 3 that
you tried to crack and as you have realized you didn't
do a very good job of cracking it.  I have spent over
six hours playing the game to have it all deleted on
me, not much fun.  So what can I do to get a new copy
of the game because I am not paying to get a new copy
as it is not my fault you guys didn't crack it
properly in the first place?!
Please reply to open_up_a_can@yahoo.com.au
Thank you.      
      </pre>
      <p>First the developers have probably spend some more time to create the game and they are surely not very pleased
      to see you trying to play a pirated copy.<br>
        <br>
          Second you have surely <b>not</b> paid <b>us</b> to get a pirated copy of the game.<br>
            <br>
              Did you order the full-service-package incl. the insurance against software failures? Didn't you read the

            Look into the phonebook. Most of us already have got telephones, some even cellular phones, so you should be
            able to give us a call regardless where we are. Isn't that fantastic, too? And in the phonebook you'll find

Hello PARADOX, I am an user of PLAYSTATION and before anything 
I want to congratulate you for your work that is fantastic. Give 
then you are the best.    
Good the reason of this E-MAIL is to communicate that the patch 
that you published of the Final Fantasy IX-Spanish it doesn't work.    
The PSX is blocked when I introduce the CD. As if has not put the 
patch.    
    
Thank you for your time and a lot of luck            
      </pre>
            <p>Hola Enrique? Que tal? At first I want to congratulate you that you are one of the few Spaniards
            contacting us in English. That's really great. Well done.<br>
              Nevertheless the patch worked well, tested by a cool Spaniard and probably by his sister. Zweifeld loves
              that girl.</p>

If u need the isos i can provide u the french iso of the 4 cds.

            <p>No, because or Chinese members have been put into jail and might face the death penalty for hacking so

Hey there,

I just made a copy of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 using your patch 
(pdx-ths2.ppf). The patch read me notes mention a PAL/NTSC 
selector but after I burned the game and loaded it, the 
title/cheat menu says that it is PAL fixed. That screen is fine 
until I begin the game and then I get this rolling b/w mess. Is 
there PAL/NTSC selector, a version of your patch containing one, 
or even just a version for NTSC?

Please help this confused yankee.

            <p>Since Americanos are just like Borg and try to assimilate everything in order to celebrate it as own
            invention, why not copying the PAL system, too, and throwing NTSC into the dustbin? I mean, I don't want to
            tell you that it seems you are too dump to fuck if you try PAL on NTSC. Some stupid girls reported dump
            persons do it better (dumm fickt gut). Who cares?</p>

In the game &quot;Spyro 3: Year of the dragon (PAL Version)&quot;
I have a problem with your .PPF file to crack this game.
I make a CDR-Win image with RAW option activated,
apply the crack with APPLYPPF command and burn the modified image
how I made with some other protected games.
But the game crashes at the title screen: the music do not begin
and Spyro is in a &quot;loop&quot; that he is looking around and a monster
is jumping behind Spyro.
Perhaps your patch does not works?
