RockmanX - These guys have really improved themselves this month. I was quite
surprised by their coding skills after checking out some of their games that
worked on NTSC systems. They had several nice patches / PAL and NTSC
compatible games etc this month. Along with them were the PAL dupes of the
last couple months also though. There are a few releases to explain on here.
Live Wire was a beta as KALISTO had the exact same thing and was even given it
as a beta. If it is proven that it is not a beta, it will be given full
points. Retro Force and Tank Racer looked like betas, but no proof on those 2
or anything to make them be judged as such until they hit the stores. Yaroze
Collection is not a retail game and looks to be mini games or something of
that sort, therefore it will get 1 like all mini games / collectors discs etc.
Another thing to note is the very nice speed they had on Last Blade at the end
of the month. Doing JAP games on Thursday morning is not something that all
groups are able to do, great job on that one. Overall Paradogs has a large
improvement from last month, just like KALISTO who they were tied with last
month. I expect about the same performance from them next month.
 
Breakdown - Ok PDX is a mixed bag of goods. Strange releases and superb
coding. And just for all you EUROS out there we don't have anything against
PAL games as long as you do it like PDX and make em work on NTSC also :). Good
job PDX and now I wanna see a demo so I can remember my good old SNES days.
I was going to comment on some of the games and why they got what score, but
that other guy that writes part of these charts beat me on it. Don't wanna
dupe him and bore you.
