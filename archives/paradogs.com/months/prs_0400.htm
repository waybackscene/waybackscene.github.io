Hi!

i downloaded a pdx patch for sagafrontier 2 protection fix from
megagames.com. I made a image of the game using CdrWin. I named it
to sa2. Then i extracted the patch and put it in the same directuory
as the image. Then i opened a dos box and changed directory to the
directory containing the image and patch ans typed &lt;GamePatch.EXE&gt;
and nothing happend it just changed line. Is this correct or am i
doing something wrong if thats the case please tell me how to do
it correctly.

Hi there, 
First let me say what a great job you do. Here's the problem,
I got your protection fix patch for f1 2000. It does remove
the protection when the game is loading, but there is more
protection. Every time I go to start a hot lap or out lap in
the weekend mode, the game sends you back to the main menu as
soon as you start the lap. This is the same with quick race.
- Please could you create or update the patch as this is such
a good game .Or let me know if it is just me doing something wrong
- Ta
                              Crevice 

p.s. there seems to be big problems with your website at the mo!!

Thanks for all of your excellent efforts!!

I have just applied the Redneck patch for EA sports F1 2000 dated
03/24/00.
It unlocks the game but when you select a race it quits &amp; defaults to
the menu or when the car passes Start/Finish line, it quits to the menu.
Have I done something wrong or is the patch bugged? I would appreciate
your help if you can spare time. Thanks in anticipation &amp; keep up great
work!!

ISO Bullshit an
kein mensch weiß wie das Funzt woher auch ??? Englisch können die wenigen .

Ich versuche einen Patch zu finden (F1 2000 PPF Patch) , 
mein erster Gedanke ( paradox )
die sind immer Startklar bei so etwas aber ????? am 23.03.2000 draußen und 
immer noch nix , warum ????

Jungs wer immer und wo immer ihr seid , lasst euch nicht unterkriegen

          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's definately nice to hear that you declare this site to be perfect but we don't neglect Paradox online. In what way do we neglect the website? Can you please explain?<br>
          You pointed out that English is only spoken by a few people. I personally have never laughed more while reading mails before. I truely hope this was meant as a joke or did I miss something in the fast three days and the world changed that much and English is no longer the most important language on this planet? Ok, it seems you don't understand English but having a look at your German spellings it doesn't look much
          better in my humble opinion. Hopefully you have still some more years in school to go and enough time to increase your skills. I keep my fingers crossed.</font></p>

up to when the naughty dog box is opened and all the characters come
out, then it just hangs on the same screen just as it did b4 i applied

Hi!

I am new in PSX iSO. This was the first time I downloaded your releases,
and I would like to ask some information about &quot;using&quot;:). Sorry if these
are stupid questions, but I haven't written PSX iso so far.
So I downloaded Discworld Noir, Rally Masters and Medievil 2, and my
questions are:
1. (RallyMasters): what is the PAL/NTSC selector? I know these systems,
but why must I use it, must at all?
2. (Medievil2): if I don't apply the FIX.EXE the game won't run? And is
the situation same at all of such type of games?
3. I didn't get any crack or fix to Discworld Noir. Doesn't it need one,
so can I simply burn it?

Thank you for your answers,
                                           Tromos</font>

DVD doesn't run because the Ps2 read only the japanese DVD. What
I can do to view the italian DVD on the japanese version of
Playstation 2?

Write me at:  bonsim@tiscalinet.it

P.S.The code to read the american DVD on the japanese Playstation
2 works for the Italian DVD?</font>

How do i go about getting my web site listed on your 'links'
page. Also, as we put all patches on-line as soon as we get them,
is there anyway that we can be e-mailed the patches direct from
you??

Ciao,
I've only a pair of little question for you.

First one:
I think that Syphon Filter 2 Italian (or EURO) version is copy protected. 
is correct? have you a patch for this cd?

Second (and last) one:
Where I can download your patch?

Let me know
Best Regards

Hi there people from PDX !
Why don't you release P/N SELECTOR as soon as NTSC specialized group release 
their stuff ?
I'm just fed up playing Ntsc games, or waiting for weeks and weeks to see 
mothafukkin' Pal4U patches with a lamer name on my boot screen...
I'm not the only one TO REALLY LIKE CRACKTROZZZ ! ;-)

I come from Atari/Amiga scenes, and intros ARE the crew, they reflect the 
real power of the sceners...
You in PDX are from this true dudez, so please, spread your name with good 
selectors, kool trainers, and blast'em all !

--=[exeo]=--

// is there a board where i can find kool ftpz with any of your releases ?

// is there any people in PDX console coming from the old PDX Amiga, or even 
QUARTEX crew ???</font>
</pre>

          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we have other, more important things to do? Remember, this is a hobby only.<br>Yes, there are certain old Paradox Amiga members in the team, otherwise we would <b>not</b> be Paradox.</font></p>
