          No, you haven't heard it before?<br>
          The European store version of Jackie Chan Stuntmaster has been delivered&nbsp; without the Libcrypt key
          disabling the copy protection while playing, so you can enjoy the original
          Sony version till level 3 only.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Bad luck for Sony? Bad luck for the customers? No, because you can
          apply <b>our</b> patch to play the entire levels without problems. Any
          questions left?

          <p>After reading the contents of our website you have probably found

          Still several people use to ignore these warnings so we are finally forced, as the very <b>last</b> solution, to publish those requests here where all authorities and software distributors/developers can pick up the information for any legal actions.

It seems when I try to patch files and stuff, Im just copying, pasting and 
useing other programs to do it for me. Im using the &quot;easy&quot; way or the &quot;cheat&quot; 
way. I know you put it up there so I don't have to learn everything in one 
night before they use the programs. But, I do want to take the time to learn 
everything so I don't have to count on other peoples programs and sources 
to do it for me. I started playing games with my Commodore 64 and still 
play them. I started programming 2 years ago. I have those basics down. 
I want to start with the basic's, print the words &quot;Hello World!&quot; on the 
screen. Then, advance to graphics and sound. Where should I start? Not get 
the source to print the words, but a source with explanations.

(My english is bad so i write in german(i now &quot;paradox&quot;has german members)
Welches format haben die PSX 2 CD´s? Ich dachte das sie DVD´s sind, aber das
kann ja nicht sein, da ihr (ihr seid einfach die besten) patches
rausgebracht habt! Irgendwie habe ich das nicht mit den umbauen der konsole
verstanden! Muss man doch - habe ich jedenfalls beider &quot;Playstation 2 - Swap
trick - Lesson&quot; gelesen!?! Irgend etwas mit einer schwarzen und weißen
disk?!? Könntest du (oder ihr)mir das erklären! Nur Kurz- sollst ja keine
ahrien schreiben!!!
Werden die neuen Spiele (oder europäschischen) dann auf dvd sein oder einen
Kopierschutz haben?
Und wie sieht es aus mit einem Umbau das man sie nur noch reinlegen brauch!
(Bastellt ihr eigendlich auch an der Entwicklung von Umbauten?)

&quot;buy the originals&quot; but i have stuck with you since the days of the amiga and 
dont what to stop now anyway i happen to like the intros as so do 99.9 percent

ps could i suggest your  artwork could be incorporated into psx covers as this 
would be totally rated!!!and it may even piss off the fucking mindless bastards

Hey &amp; big thanks for all the nice work you do!

I got problems with the &quot;Michelin Rally Masters&quot; german pal version.
I used the PARADOGS - Crack but it won´t work.
It tells me, that the patch has worked but after burning, the game stoped on 
loading into the track.
What do I wrong? 
Is the patch maybe a fake?

Please contact me under 

Pitiplatsch123!@aol.com

          <p>If you really have a Parado<b>gs</b> patch it's definately a fake. Try to get the Parado<b>x</b> version instead.</p>

Would it be possible for you to make a .ppf patch for this game?  It's a 
different game than Card Captor Sakura, which you guys have already done, but 
I think it uses the same protection(same developers), and you can't play it 
using Action Replay codes, as it just doesn't load up then.  I have the game 
(legit copy no less), but it sucks to not even be able to play it.

Just a request,

Hallo Leute,

tut mir leid Euch zu sagen, aber euer Crack für Euro 2000 (PSX)
funktioniert nicht.
Ich kann zwei Spiele machen (manchmal sogar nur eins) und danach startet
das ganze Spiel neu und ich kann nichts mehr steuern oder beeinflussen.

Wäre nett wenn Ihr den Fehler beheben könntet. Danke.

Ansonsten leistet Ihr gute Arbeit.

Myself and a friend are currently working on a website (www.xxxx.xx.uk) that
provides downloadable PSX isos. We have a patch section with all the latest
patches etc... but its hard to find these patches before anyone else... We
are wondering if we could come to some agreement where you could send us
your newly released patches which we could throughly test and publish on the
site.
Not only would this increase the popularity of our site, but we would be
able to give you feedback on your patches i.e. bugs etc...

          <p>At first much respect from my side. You guys must have lots of
