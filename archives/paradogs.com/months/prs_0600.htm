Feedback:=              My feedback:
            we've got a Waitec burner and we want to make a back-up of F1 
2000 with that patch engine, but when we try the patched game in the PSX we 
can't go further than screeen where is made advertisement for the one who 
made the patch. Is it because we got the wrong burner or did we just do 
something wrong? We used CDRwin to make the image file and then applied 
the patch with PPF-o-Matic v. 2 Then we burned it to a TDK disk with load 
cuesheet at CDRWin. 

I hope you can help us solve this problem.

Hi I am Italian, I have seen that you are experienced on the crack. I ask you a help, 
I want to learn to create the crack for playstation. I have looked at on internet, but 
I have found few explanations. There are a program PPF-o-matic the use for apply and 
create the patch. In the explanations do the very easy commands be depicted from use.
I don't know (that difference is there?) like build a [original_file.bin] and a 
[patched_file.bin] with CDRWin.

This is the file taken from the site.
How to use MakePPF.exe

To create a PPF-File is simple.. You have to enter a very
easy commandline like this e.g.:

MakePPF [Original_ISO.bin] [Patched_ISO.bin] [PPF_FILE-Output]
Original_ISO would be the Original untouched CDRWin binfile. ( Like does it be built?)
Patched_ISO would be the Patched TOUCHED:) CDRWin binfile. ( Like does it be built?)


PPF_FILE would be the filename of the PPF-Output.
Please be sure that the filesize of the Original and Patched iso
files are identical!

After you entered the right commandline, MakePPF asks you for a
PPF-Patch description.. enter here a short explanation e.g. what
the patch does or something.. this is for identification! You
have max. 50 Chars for the description-line!!

Okay.. there you go.. just wait and the PPF-File is ready for
spreading to the world :)
Could you help me?

I have used one of your patches for Crash CTR. The game works great exept

pssible tell me if the patch was desgined to do that or it is something
else.  I have had no other problems with applying patchs for your selves for
other games, It just seams to be Crash CTR.

I just wanted to know has (Naughty Dog) got some kind of other protection
because Crash Bandicot 3, hangs on level 2.  I know that has nothing to do
with you put could you please help me.

I would apreciate any feedbak on how to resolve this problem.

Subject: WWF Smackdown patch
Date: Tuesday, 6. June 2000 03:07

Hi there,

I'm trying to patch my US NTSC version of WWF Smackdown with your PAL/NTSC selector. 
However, the game's movies are in black &amp; white, as with the menus (NTSC, obviously.) 
The rest is successfully in PAL. Is there a patch which I can use to make the movies 
and menus run in colour (PAL) as well? If not, could you please update the patch to 
support these? I tried PAL4U as well and the same thing happens. I have seen a large 
number of messages in boards which ask if there is a patch which will fully convert 
the game to PAL (or selector which will do that.) Please consider updating this patch 
for a full conversion to PAL!

Thanks a lot,

- Matt Silversides (Matt@msilversides.freeserve.co.uk)

            Hi I know your very busy people but
please! can you help me I'm having trouble applying
your patches, (I download them from www.megagames.com
then the PSX link)

I copyied Hogs Of War using no patches or anything and
when it came up Bruno blah blah presents the game just
stops there (wasted CD) so I copyied it again using
your patch see below:

I have recently tried to apply the &quot;Hogs Of War&quot; UK
Protection Fix patch, I followed all the instructions
concerning making a image file using CDRWIN I then
used PPF-O-Matic program to apply the patch file to
the Bin file (no errors came up) I then burned the
CDRWIN patched image file to CD-R using CDRWIN I
loaded the cue sheet and everything and after it had
finished I popped it into my chipped PSX then it
loaded as normal and the PAL/NTSC select screen came
up then the Paradox screen came up (the one with the
Devil &amp; the Angel) saying Hogs Of War etc. I then
pressed Start and the Infogrames screen came up and it
said LOADING the when it says Bruno (whoever made the
game) presents it just stopped there so even though
the Paradox thing came up the game still does not
work. Am I doing anything wrong?

Please Please Help I have tried patching other games
such as Resident Evil 3 and that didn't work either,
Thanks for your time please help!

Please reply to CJM1999@Yahoo.com

Your high and mighty 'we don't condone piracy'
bullshit  disclaimers littered all over your website
are sick. The stance you take with people who email
you is crap as well, what do you fucking expect when
you write patches for games?

your ps2 releases are lame, it must take all of 5
minutes to patch a couple of filename references, i
bet it takes longer to write the 'spank your own
monkey' greets files.

need 25 blonde and brunettes with big tits for your
next meeting? the only tits you will find will be
members im afraid, you would all probably shit
yourselves anyway so its probably a good thing.
</pre>
      <p>At first nobody forces anyone on this planet to mail us, so we can't get your point. We clearly stated that we are <b>not</b> interested in receiving
      this kind of mail. If you think you have to mail us we are free to do whatever we feel to do with that kind of junk mail. Do you think we are interested
      in reading such a crap day in day out?</p>
      <p>Well, if <b>our</b> PS2 releases are lame you must compare them with other PS2 releases. Who is actually releasing those cool PS2 releases? Even you?
      You can surely prove your claims. Or are you one of those punks selling your soul for being in the position to create such lame patches as we do? Are you
      just jealous? It's not our fault that you are a faceless nobody.</p>
      <p>As you seem to be just a big-mouthed lamer with no real life who is trying to gain some attention you would surely love to pay $2,500.00 for the
      privilege to participate in one of our notorious meetings. If you did not get the satirical aspect of that statement made answering to another dumb
      inquiry we feel very sorry for you but Paradox meetings are for sure a remarkable highlight for lowlifes like you. You would even report it to your

Après l'avoir prêté 1 semaine à un copain, je l'ai récupéré avec
beaucoup de rayures.

Je souhaiterai savoir si vous possédez le batch pour ce jeu en PAL afin
que je puisse le faire gravé par un copain et ainsi éviter d'user
l'original.

On m'a dit que je pouvais le faire copié pour mon usage personnel,
pouvez-vous me le confirmer.

Merci par avance de votre réponse.

I know I am not supposed to ask about patches, but I am desperatly trying to 
find patches for Dracula Resurection (I believe a German Pal release) and 
Euro 2000 (pal). The ones that are out there do not work. I don't expect a 
response, but if you guys could get a patch out there I would be much 
appreciated. Thanks and keep p the good work.

mouse, so im able to use keyboard only, anyhow i came across applyPPF.exe so 
i d/l and open it in the same folder as my .bin file and .ppf file i had 
opened applyppf.exe and it had showed that the exe was in sleep mode and 
anytime i hit a key it terminates the program withought patchin the bin, im 
not real familiar with dos. ive tried other ways to patch usin ppf-o-matic 
though it will not let me use the keyboard to manually type the directory of 
the the .bin and .ppf file. wonderin if you could help me out on this and 
tell me if im doing something wrong with applyppf.exe and if so how to do it 
right. thanks and greatly appreciated

Subject: for ya psx-guys outta there
Date: Thursday, 29. June 2000 21:21

hi there,

ive an idea about another psx-program, kind of 'trainer-menü-maker' for
l8mrs like me, hehe. :o)
ive got the comms-link card and creating my own trainers, searching the psx-opcode
for decrementing lives (subu v0,v0,v1..) or whatever and noppig them out. btw ive
cracked/trained games on c64/Amiga years ago. im not able to code a complete trainer-menü
on psx, so it would be kewl if the program i need could do this:

-giving addresses which will be overwritten, for e.g. 80158190 -&gt; 24 42 FF FC
 should be replaced with &gt; 00 00 00 00 (nop it out). however it could be
 a double or word-size, but mips-assembly is 4 bytes, so i think its better
 for this case.
-giving text to this address(es) for e.g. &quot;unlimited lives?&quot;
-a own scrolltext for the menü can be written
-a own logo can be shown (tim-files)
-after creating it, it has to patch the cd-iso image file, so that the cd boot
 boot with this trainer-menü and options.

so, can look very stupid, but would be useful for guys like me :o)

please drop me a line what you think of it, im not coding on psx,
so i dont know if its possible or not.

regards.
