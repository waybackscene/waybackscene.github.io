 Paradox strikes again. Cool to see these guys in action. I've
 enjoyed their quality releases since the SNES days and all three of
 these games are no exception. Asterix &amp; Obelix struck me as one
 of the best platform games I've played lately on any system while I
 tried it out on my V2 gb-x card to let Rotox know if the V2 had any
 problem with it (it didn't :) I think F1 Grand Prix is the best
 racing game out on GBC at the moment. I really enjoyed F-1 Race and
 this game, though made by a different company, has some of the same
 features as it (I'm just glad I don't wipe out in this one around
 the Z turns like I did often in F-1 Race ;) Hugo 2 1/2 is a strange
 game, but has some pretty fun levels where you can swim, ski, and
 fly. Excellent job on these quality releases!

 Paradox does it again. I have been waiting for F1 GP for a while and
 it was worth it. Great releases this month, hope to a lot more from ya.

 - BigRedPimp/Rapid Fire


 A fair month for PDX, they improved over their May releases by
 offering games that were not previously available with different
 title screens. Solid European releases, hope to see more from PDX
 soon.

 Three good games appeared this month from the Paradogs, who show
 some real signs of dominating the European releases. With the
 rumoured introduction of some quality trainermakers in the near
 future, expect PDX to creep up the charts over the summer months...

 - Wayne Kerr/Capital


 Asterix &amp; Obelix was yet another example of a game put together
 in too short time. When are developers and publishers going to
 become more serious about Gameboy development? It's really a
 shame...
