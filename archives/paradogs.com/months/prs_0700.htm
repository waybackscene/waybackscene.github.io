Subject: Question about Backup Cracks
Date: Sunday, 2. July 2000 20:51

Paradox Staff,

I just wanted to make sure that the Legend of Dragoon patch must be
applied to all four disks.  Also I have tried with my copy of Saga
Frontier II and also my firends and I have been unable to backup that
game using the patch your organization wrote.  I get a message saying
that the .bin file is not the correct size for the patch, and if I
continue to apply the patch the resulting disk becomes worthless.
Please let me know if there is an updated crack and if so where I might
be able to find it.  Thanks.  
</pre>
      <p>We hardly encourage you using original software only. Then problems like this won't occur.</p>

Can you guys (gals?) help.

I have used your PSX patch and your UK 2+ trainer patch on a CDR bin file. 
Each time I can play the game once okay, but if I try a second time it hangs 
on the Playstaion logo screen. In both cases the patch said it had applied 
successfully and both burns where fine. What an I doing wrong? Any ideas.

Thanks in advance

Hi,

I have an original copy of Spyro 2 (UK PAL) and downloaded the patch so that
I could make a backup copy of the game (it is one of yours, attached is the
.diz file from this, unfortunately whenever I try and load a saved game in
the psx crashes and I get a black screen, just thought I would write and let
you know, just incase it some type of copy protection method used that you
never found when creating the patch.  I have tried 3 times to copy the game
using patches downloaded from various sources but as yet have not managed to
get one workin at all.

I recently download the Patch for &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;
(Psx), backup was created with the right version and
the patch was applied succesfully with the Gui
interface you've created.  The problem is that when
i've burned the patched game and i try it on my
console, the screen stops at the Psx prompt.  My
console is cracked and i've respected your
recommandations. (software used :CDRWin 3.7e) Is it
speed of disc?  Help please... it's not the first time
the problem appears...

Hi from down under!!!!

Just a quick mail to ask for help with one of your cracks...I have tried
applying this to a PAL version to Resident Evil 3 using PPF-o-matic...and it
says &quot;patch applied successfully&quot;, however after apparently burning the
patched image back to a cdr and running the game on the Playstation it shows
your crack screen and credit's then goes to the warning screen about gore
and violence..before then locking up

I have tried using Cdrwin and CloneCD but with the same result..my burner is
an Acer 4432.

Any help/advice would be appreciated.
