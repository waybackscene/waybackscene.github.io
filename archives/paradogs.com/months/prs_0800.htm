      joke. We should send all those game lamers into concentration camps. Game lamers should buy the games. If you want to drive a Porsche you have to buy it.
      You can't steal it, explaining it with the fact that those cars are too expensive to buy them. Simple, isn't it? And piracy is always dangerous, even if

Your Medievil 2 -Crack/PN/Trainer that I found at www.megagames.com 
doesn't seem to work. Now please tell me how is it supposed to function.  
I took the origial disc (SCEE MediEvil 2 PAL) and made an image with 
Goldenhawk CDRWin 3.8 . You know, with the .bin file and .cue file.  
I then run your Fix.exe and when it asks for the ISO/BIN file I specified 
the .bin file. It reports successfull.  I then run CDRWin 3.8 and load the 
Cuesheet and start Recording. Records successfull. Place in Playstation with 
Modchip, Then *&amp;@#*.&quot;!!! No cigar! All I want is protection fix.  Please so

Hi! My name is Julio Velez, from Mexico.

First of all, I want to congratulate you all for your excellent work! You
guys are amazing.

Yesterday I downloaded from www.mxxxxxxxx.com the file pdx-st2u.ppf to
unprotect my us version of Strider 2. I followed the instructions word by
word, but the copy don´t works. The disc starts, your screen is shown, but
after selecting the trainer options, the antimodchip message from CAPCOM
appears... so I don´t know if I made something wrong or the process failed
for some other reason.

I know that you are very busy with important thing and maybe my question is
stupid, but please help me if you can.

Thanks in advance and congratilations again.

Sincerely,

Hello paradox team,

Your Strider 2 US patch isn't working on my playstation,

Thx

      <p>Ok Steve. A remote analysis of your system is not possible. Please send us all your PC and PSX equipment and then we can check it.</p>

Hello,

I am a huge fan of your PDX patches for PSX games, especially the protection 
fixes.  I would like to request a protection fix patch for Strider II as I 
have been waiting for one to be developed for a long time.  Can you please 
make one?  Thank you.      
</pre>
      <p>Yes, ofcourse, since we do <b>not</b> have better things to do than fullfilling those few thousands patch requests.</p>

Hi Guys,

How about Sidney olympics2000(pal)???            
</pre>
      <p>Doesn't match? File not found error or what? Syntax error? Data error? We need more details.</p>
