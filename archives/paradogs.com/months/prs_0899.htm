Not only the scene press but aswell the commercial console magazines has followed the activities of Paradox. This time it was a German magazine called &quot;<b>World Of PlayStation</b>&quot;, number 17 - August 1999, having had a look at the patches, trainer versions and ofcourse at this homepage.

Hi,
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Just out of curiosity how difficult was it for you guys to produce
the V-Rally 2 patch?<br>
The implementation was a bit weak due to deadlines, but 2 weeks was
my guess for timing between launch and copying.<p>

<tr><td bgcolor="#333333"> <center><font size="5">Re-Crack by
DW00</font></center> <p align="JUSTIFY"> First of all a word about
the protection used in V-Rally 2. There's no so called
anti-modchip protections in the game. Just take an original,
throw it in your mod equipped console and boot it. Works just
fine. So stop spreading rumors about that. There are no
anti-modchip game released in europe so far and probably none
will. So much about that.<p>

<center><font size="5">Few words about the Paradox
crack.</font></center> <p align="JUSTIFY"> Fine piece of work but
intros on consoles suck big time. There are in fact some people
out there who have to pay their phonebills and are not interested
at all in downloading several hundred KBytes just to watch your
Paradox intro over and over. We didnÄ«t trash our Amigas just to
go through this again.<p>

<center><font size="5">How it works?</font></center> <p align="JUSTIFY"> Just as easy like taking candy from a baby. Use
your favorite CD-recording software to extract your original
V-Rally 2 disc (hope you have one! :)) to an image. Use the
program on the image then make as many copies as you like and
give it to all your friends. Well, the kind of thing you normally
do. The program searches through the image for the locations to
patch. You'll get a success message if it has been patched. The
patch will hopefully work with quite a bunch of recording
software. It has been tested to work with Jeff Arnold's CDRWIN
(best program on the market) and Nero (you'll get a warning about
a wrong field or something. Don't care. We never do.). It won't
work with Prassi. Though luck.<p>

Best regards to all the PSX Groups out there.<br>

Hello people!<p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"> We have been happy helping all the friends we
have in PSX land for the last years.

<p align="JUSTIFY"> But lately things have happened which we can
<b>not</b> tolerate...

<p align="JUSTIFY"> I am talking about lamers like DW00 from ZPC 99
who are 're-cracking' (copying our work) and releasing this crap.

<p align="JUSTIFY"> We are doing this to help gamers all over the
world, but certenly not to have our work copied by such
copy-cats, who steal our work, and try to take the credit.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
It is up to you if you want to support such lame acts...

<p align="JUSTIFY"> And it is also up to you if you want more
quality releases from <b>Paradox</b>.

<p align="JUSTIFY"> If this behaviour continues, and will get
support from those who matters (that is you people), then there
will be no more cracks, patches or trainers from us.

<p align="JUSTIFY"> And if we stop, the lame copy-cats will stop
too, they can only copy work but not crack the games them selves.

<p align="JUSTIFY"> I would like to you send emails stating what
you feel about lame behavior to the un-sympatic people at
ZPC99...

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Use this email address to reach them:<br>

Well, this is indeed the weakest excuse for recracking and
lamness I have ever heard or seen on all the platforms I have
been active on.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
At first the size of a patch/crack/trainer version from Paradox
is rather small in size, that means less than 1 MB. Even with a
slow 28k8 modem it's down in max. 4 minutes. If a download of 4
minutes is too expensive for you we have a good solution for you:<p>

<center>Support your console and buy the original!</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">
It is your very own decision to trash a computer system, may it
be an Amiga, a Commodore 64, a Sinclair, a PC or a Mac. If you
don't like intros infront of releases there's nothing wrong about
it. We don't like lamers like you either.<br>
The intros are our credit for our work. All the people who think
it's more smart to use a &quot;security&quot; backup instead of
the original CD should always remember who made it possible. If
you don't like to show the well deserved respect for our work
and you don't like the intros there is one fine solution:<p>

<center>Support your console and buy the original!</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Infront of originals there are <b>no</b> annoying Paradox intros
and you have <b>not</b> wasted a few hundred KB for the download.
It is your very own decision.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
To say it straight: <b>no</b> intros means <b>no</b> Paradox releases.
If you'd like to see Paradox being active in the future for your
benefits we'd like to request you helping us around, too. Any informations
about the identity of those code-rippers may be sent to
<a href="mailto:pdx99@gmx.net" onmouseover="window.status='Code rippers'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''">Paradox</a>
and any protest notes may be send to the lame
<a href="mailto:guocrew@hotmail.com?subject=Stop it!" onmouseover="window.status='Lamers Inc.'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''">code-rippers</a>.<br>
Always remember: without the initial Paradox releases those code-rippers can't come up with their lame recracks. The consequences should
be quite clear to everyone. It's your very own decision.

<p>Regards,<p>

Breakdown - I gotta give it to PDX for coding a util for the benefit of the
PSX scene. I think the PSX scene needs more of this and PDX set a good example
It seems that after the first week or so in JULY the games stop coming, but
the patches didn't. PDX remains undoubtly the best coding group for the PSX.
I don't see the need for 10 different Ape Escape cracks, but that is just me.
I guess the Frogs and Krauts on slow connections need it, but still I think
those patches are kinda crap (the game is way old now). Nascar 99 had no
differences compared to the previous version so it earns a DUPE.
Rumours have it that there has been some major turmoil within the group and
some of the guys have left to form spin offs etc. it will be interesting to
see what happens, but as long as the quality coding does the talking I think
they will be ok.

RockmanX - PDX had a decent month. Their games were not so great, but their
patches made up for that. The PPF format was a GREAT idea since this can
be run on many platforms and not just Windows. The Ape Escape patches
towards the end of the month were kind of lame but theyll get points 
anyway. PDX seems to have stopped doing games and going only to patches,
this is a pretty wise choice as most of their games were total crap and
the patches is where the good part of PDX lies. Good luck with the 
coding next month.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
regarding the once again quite interesting judgements and comments in PSX World 07/99 we feel the time has come
to comment the few ones we don't agree with. Plain and simple.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
<b>Nascar 99 Legacy</b> has to declared as a dupe even if the editors have admitted that the Paradox version contains
new tracks. Curiously often a simple time stamp in the directory has been proof enough for the final store version, so
we'd like to request the value of new levels completing the game, infact being the store version. Seems to be not enough.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
<b>V-Rally 2</b> has been the most awaited release this year, followed by
<b>Ape Escape</b>, two releases containing the first <u>real</u> protections.
One could show off and request who did it remove it first and who did not, but that is rather pointless
here. Still it is a mystery for the entire scene, except for Kalisto, how Kalisto could add themselves +3
points for an uncracked, unplayable ISO file. If an uncracked ISO is worth +3 points, one has the right
to request what's the value for the crack? +1? :)

<p align="JUSTIFY"> Last but not least let's have a look at some
unqualified statements.
<br><br>
<blockquote>
<b>Breakdown</b>: I
don't see the need for 10 different Ape Escape cracks, but that
is just me. I guess the Frogs and Krauts on slow connections need
it, but still I think those patches are kinda crap (the game is
way old now).<br>
<b>RockmanX</b>: The Ape Escape patches
towards the end of the month were kind of lame but theyll get
points anyway.
</blockquote>
<br><br>

Well, in Europe there exist a lot of countries with lots of
different languages. It might be new for you, so please listen
carefully, that Germans speak German, in France people speak
French, in Spain Spanish or in Italy they usually prefer Italian.
This list could be continued, naming the language for any every
country over here. Atleast it might get clear that people are
normally speaking different languages in different countries and
prefer to see the warez delivered in their mother's tongue as it
is by far more comfortable than working with a foreign language.
One could now start to explain that in those countries only the
localised versions are going to be distributed, speak the German
version in Germany etc., but we don't want to confuse you with
too much new information at once. Perhaps your knowledge about
the different versions and varied protection methods was too
limited, as you have proven quite often so far, so it was always
a new challenge to remove them on request.<br>

It's quite nice that you grant us the points for our work, we are
indeed very grateful if we see that you give yourself +3 points
for a not cracked and unplayable ISO. Merci beaucoup. Muchas
gracias. Herzlichen Dank. Bedankt.
<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Breakdown</b>:
Nascar 99 had no differences compared to the previous version so it earns a DUPE.
</blockquote><br><br>
First you admit that there are new tracks added and second you can't see any differences.
It makes as much sense as some other judgements made in the and all previously released
issues.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Finally the overall judgement.<p>

Well, well, well. We have already seen a whole bunch of shit this month and electing the top loser could become an exciting challenge. Those nerds would have the best chances to end up in the top three rankings.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
At first it seems not to be necessary to point of that Paradox [PDX] is in <b>no</b> way affiliated to the so-called World-Piracy-Webring [WPW]. Freefall and xor37h are for sure still members of Paradox.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Second it is quite nice to see when other groups are accepting the challenge of cracking and patching on our beloved console. A bit of competition could not hurt. But WPW explaining to have cracked V-Rally 2 with the help
of Paradox can only be a small sick joke. But we have already seen elsewhere what people are doing for a few points or expecting a piece of the cake.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Finally it is quite amazing to see that WPW owns the copyright, definately not copyrights, on the crack patch. We do <b>not</b> intend to give a lesson about copyright here but if someone owns any rights on the crack patch
of V-Rally 2 it is Paradox and nobody else. Period.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Unfortunately the homepage has been down for unknown reasons. According to the hoster this web presence was temporary unavailable. We will keep an eye on it. It's no big deal to get the name and address of the registered C-admin.
If you are interested to complain about WPW's lameness, an act that could prevent the public and unrestricted distribution of patches or trainers in the future, then please leave mail to
<a href="mailto:W-P-W@gmx.net?subject=Lame Rippers" onmouseover="window.status='Rippers Online'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''">W-P-W@gmx.net</a> and explain your disliking
of this inacceptable behaviour.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Atleast we will be very pleased to introduce an <b>anti-ripping-protection</b> in future distributions. This new, unique system is currently under heavy construction and perhaps a nightmare for code rippers like WPW or ZPC99.
Once again an innovation by Paradox! Don't immitate - innovate!

<p>On behalf of Paradox,<p>
