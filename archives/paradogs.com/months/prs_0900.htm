Hi
I'm in Sydney Australia. I've just tried to patch the
Sydney 2000 PSX with pdx-sypc.ppf. It looks like the
Australian version is different from UK. Normally all
UK patches work here. The size is 602877. Your file
did say that the size was different than the file it
was originally patched for, but I tried it anyway.
Your splash screen comes up, but it hangs with a red
bar when it's about to load.

Keep up the good work.

Dear Paradogs Staff,

It seems that there is an error in one of your patches. 

I bought the psx game Galerians (german vers.) and I've patched the first cd with 
pdx-ggc1.ppf by Patch-O-Matic v2.0. Then I did a backup with cdrwin 3.8b. After psx 
booting, the paradogs demo starts but after that it hangs up while loading (before the 
crave logo). 

By time you can reply and inform me what error(s) it is.

Have a great futur.

Hi Paradox. I've been trying to dload your new Strider 2 US patch, 
but none of the patches on your website have .zip files for dload. 
So um, how can I dload the patch when there is no file to click on?
Thanx for your

Dear Pardox I ahve some info for you about your 

Sidney 2000 Uk Pal patch. 

It would seem that they may be a problem with it , when you are play in the vavelin 
games the graphics go all over the place , they become all unstable and slow .May be 
you could release a fixed patch some time soon.!

Hey!  

I would like to congratulate to you to your Homepage.  That is with 
distance the geilste and bestsortierteste page which I up to now found,
 if it concerns Patches! 
I would gladly times have known, why there are so many Patches with coach 
for US/NTSC of plays?  The Patches has a PAL/NTSC Selector, but for the 
US/NTSC version.  

Example:  Nightmare Creatures2 of +6 coaches (PAL/NTSC Selector) US/NTSC 
version.  Rayman 2 (PAL/NTSC Selector) 
US/NTSC version. 
That should not be a criticism, but it would be simply fantastic if, it 
in this point something undertake could. 
You since the best ones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Many greetings  

Ben

            Please help me on making a PPF file for Prassi DVD rep software.
I am currently burning DVD-ROM PS2 games and I use Prassi to copy the disc.
This software uses the UDF file system. It creates an image file with the
extension &quot;.udi&quot;. I have been trying to crack several of the ps2 game exes
but have not been able to create a universal patcher for that software. I
have the hardware to burn the image file to as well.  Please contact me at

Replace the original euro2000.exe with the enclosed file at the end of
