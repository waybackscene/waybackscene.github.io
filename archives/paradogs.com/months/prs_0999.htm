<p align="JUSTIFY">
A well meant tip. On the other hand how comes it that the HK silver version
is cracked unlike all the other versions that can be purchased across the globe? Has Accession cracked it themselves?<br><br>
The answer is <b>no</b>. This HK silver version is based on <font face="PosterBodoni BT">Sm0n</font>'s version
and it is <b>no</b> secret that Sm0n belongs to Paradox.<br><br>
However, you guys are right. It makes no sense to &quot;crack&quot; this special HK silver Mulan version with a further patch.<p>

Team Paradox<p>

Yes we leaked or sumthing leaked.<p>

i trid sfv on it and on psx lame patchfile and it seems they had
same file after 5 or 6 hours we got it. sfv repots the file is
same we didnt wanna put this patch out as we wanted to do ntsc
selector on it with our intro, when we noticed lame pdx put out
crack patch we dumped the allready patched image out which
apparently showed that pdx had gotten our patch from sumone from
somewhere. Now after we got our intro and ntsc selector done and
lame kalisto shits heard about it, they putted autopatched ntsc
force lame shit piece of patch out, anyway if u need or want
selector its soon available on our web pages at
http://www.accession.org/ also just to note u why we didnt wanna
do autopatcher is that we wanna know more and for you usa dewds
if your screen doesnt go on correct place on main menu use select
buttoon to adjust the screen into correct position, this is what
those lame autopatched from accgimp didnt know and once again
proved the world that shit releases rule
</blockquote>
<p>
That's what we think about it:
<p align="JUSTIFY">

Yes, it might be that we got the same <b>patch</b> like Accession got,
the funny thing just is that it was done by <b>Sm0n</b> and our other
<b>Russian</b> friends. So actually we didnīt steal anything, but the
<b>Accession</b> release was cracked using our <b>patch</b>.<br><br>

You know, we donīt need you guys in ACC for cracking, so next
time try to verify your information and do NOT make fools outta
yourselves!<br><br>

And another advice: Do <b>not</b> talk what you wanted to do... <b>Do it</b>!

 Still good to see this old name in the charts.  Too bad Quasar isn't here
 to join them this time.

 - Amptor/Oldskool


 A fun soccer game, and Paradox ended the month with points.

 - Konfused/Indpendent


 Not much action from PDX this month, but they did get a soccer game which
 was released first in Germany. Hope to see more stuff in the following
 months.

 - Rza/Menace

 
 Only the one game from PDX this month, but it's not too bad.  The GBC was
 overdue a decent footy game, especially after the donkeys afterbirth that
 is ISS'99 GBC...expect some more from PDX during Sept as the xmas rush
 starts to get into full swing.

 - Wayne Kerr/Capital


 Paradox gb division still holding on (just), Seems pdx could be more into
 other stuff at the moment (like cracking and training psx games??)..

 - Zigor/Eurasia
