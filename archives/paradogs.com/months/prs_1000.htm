I have 2 questions:

Firstly, I live in the states and use NTSC and a friend of mine from AU 
needed VS, so I patched it with your patch. The game boots up in B/W for 
me and scrolls, so does that mean it is now in PAL format and will work 
for him? I have no way of testing this.

Secondly, I am looking for a group to create a patch for Chrono Trigger 
NTSC-J, it is a remake of an old SNES game and contains the old SNES ROM, 
but it is all in Japanese.  But I created an old .ips patch from the English 
ROM and patched the ROM, however I cannot insert the English ROM into a
PSX game. If you want to help, I can supply the game (either I will upload 
or mail you a copy on CD)

Thanks,

Edward            
</pre>
      <p>1. PAL supports colours, so if you have it in b/w it doesn't means it is in PAL format. ;-)<br>

Subject: SoulReaver German Patch
Date: Tuesday, 3. October 2000 22:35

Hi, first of all to say that of course i own the original game i'm talking about 
now, Soul Reaver German Version. For not damaging or scratching the orig. i use 
the copy.
With the PPF-Prog and CDRwin i've made a succesful patched copy. The Patch-Name 
is SoulReaver German (FIX) from 09/99. Now my Question:
The disc Boots up in the PSX, it shows your intro, then the EIDOS-Screen, 
followed by &quot;Crystal-Dynamics&quot;-Screen and then hangs up at the next one (&quot;Blood 
Omen: legacy of...bla bla).
Sometimes with LOT of luck and after about 30 MINUTES (!!) the game starts.
But only sometimes. Other copies running well, no problems with the FMV'S
i've even tried to adjust the laser..nothing helped. Once the game started, i 
have no more problems with it
but why does it work only sometimes and why it takes 30 minutes? Whey i put my 
ear on the psx, i can hear, that it's loading and searching for something... i 
don't know. Never had such problems before. please help. thanks

pnb: no idea if u prefer the emails in english or german, both 
would have done fine for me ... but since i'm expecting this mail 
to be put public for laughter, i will write in english to amuse all 
of your ... er, let's say &quot;customers&quot;.


Dear Paradox-Team (that's paradox, truely)

Remember that &quot;reaction&quot; u showed ur site-visitors time ago? 
About mails people sent u where they were asking u for _illegal copies 
of licenced software_ ?

U published some of the mails then ... 

Here are  just some questions that came to my mind reading those mails 
and ur answers :

a) does anyone of u know how much the population in the us, germany, 
switzerland, austria and UK is?
if so, does anyone of you also know how much the population in italy, 
spain, south america, france and some other places speaking french,
spanish and italian, is?

in case u didn't notice ... english and german aren't the only languages 
spoken on the world ... in fact, english's not even spoken that much
as spanish is (talking about 2nd language here) ... 

b) where are the requests for _illegal copies of licenced software_ ? 
i read not more than 2 or 3, but u published alot more mails ...

c) do u have any girlfriends? if so, did they laugh about the way u 
answered to judith?

d) do u guys ever get out of the office / home-office? in case u do, do 
u talk about something else than lamers ? lamers aren't something to be
paranoid of ... lamers are people that should be helped by guys like 
u that obviously have been blessed with a little bit more intellect than
others.

Don't get me wrong ... I'm not &quot;mad&quot; at you or something and I do understand 
the feelingst that brought u to the decision to publish those mails ... i'm 
just of the oppinion that u might have made a better effort ... most of the 
mails were only slightly ignoring ur disclaimer (although i'm pretty sure there 
are alot of emails directly ignoring ur disclaimer) ... and most of all : ur 
answers were not funny at all, although they should have ...

Have a nice day and keep making those amazing intros ... u are (in part) keeping 
the scene alive ... 

herzlichst, euer Cannabinoid            
</pre>
      <p>Ok. You got us. We know we have lost. We are unworthy creatures.<br>
      <br>
      a) The <b>scene</b>, and we are a scene group, speaks English, starting from the CBM 64, Amiga, PC and console scenes. The scene is no place for game
      lamers just looking for games but merely a sort of competition of groups messing their skills in coding, cracking, drawing and composing. In some places
      there are even regulary updated charts presenting your current scene status.<br>
      If anyone wants to contact us he has to do it in English, the official language of the scene. Nobody can really expect us to take care of any language
      spoken in the world and to present a customer service for any unexperienced game lamer who is too stupid to apply the patches correctly. Or do you even
      expect us to open a call-center for a much better service in all languages? Stop dreaming.<br>
      You are refering to populations standing behind those languages. Chinese, including all their dialects, should be undoubtable #1 and looking at the
      population in India it most be on a top spot, too. Do you expect us doing customer service in those languages, too? English is the language we offer, and
      if people aren't happy with it nobody forces them to contact us. Period.<br>
      <br>
      b) We publish all kind of stupid, unnecessary mails here. Sometimes even more or less serious ones, like this one.<br>
      <br>
      c) Just after reading my girl-friend dressed herself in that fucking hot leather suit, got her whiplash and punished me like I deserved it after answering
      that way to Judith. Fair enough. ;-)<br>
      <br>

Hi all.

My name is Darren and I live in Australia.

I'm a keen Mac user and PSX user and wanted to get a copy of your
PPF-O-Matic v2.0 for Power Macintosh.

After I downloaded it unzipped it I was only able to expand the 1st
layer of the BIN archive before
Stuffit (the bin hex expander) said that the file was corrupt and was unusable.

I tried a couple of times more but got the same message.

It appears that the copy on your site is corrupt.
Could you post another copy if possible that isn't BINHEX but is just a
ZIP for the MAC or
if it's not too much trouble, email me a copy as an attachment as I'm
keen to try it out.

Thanks guys!!

Regards,
Darren

Feedback:=My feedback:

I downloaded PPF-O-MATIC V1.0 from the internet on 18/10/2000.

Using CDRWin I created a Bin file for ape escape, I then created a PPF file using 
PPF-O-MATIC and applied the PPF File to the Bin file using the same program.  

I then recorded the file using CDRWin on to a blank CD.  At the completion of the 
copying process I tested the game. For some reason the game does not work.

Perhaps I might have done somethin wrong.  This is how I created the PPF File :

In the Original-Bin section I selected the Bin file for Ape Escape.
In the Patched-Bin section I selected the same file

When I requested to create the PPF File I was asked to give a name for the file.  
I named the file Ape.ppf.

At the completion of the ppf file creation I applied the PPF File to the bin file.  
A message was displayed that stated Patched successfully, enjoy.

Have I done something wrong ?

If so can you tell me what I have done ?

Thankyou

Hello
Here is Jimmyn@gmx.de from Germany. I need the following Patches 
for Psx
German Version:
- Cold BLOOD 
- F1 Championship Season 2000
- Tenchu 2
Or could you say me on which page could i find this Patches ?
Or could you say me how i could make this patches myself ?

I saw at Psxcopyworld that i can make with some engines the Patches
myself, but it was hard to understand. Could you write it in very
 poor English for
me? Pléase.

Sorry for my poor English.      
</pre>
      <p>Ofcourse, we don't have much better things in life to do than teaching it to you, than sending you the patches and to write it all in poor English. Are
      you really so stupid to believe in even a small percentage of a possible success?</p>

Hey guys

Could you make a PAL2NTSC selector for Final Fantasy 7, because the 
conversion itself is really crappy with HUGE borders! I would really be 
happy with such a patch and I bet many others would too.

Keep up the good work!

      <p>Man, FF9 is already out and you really expect us to waste a single minute on FF7? Consult the doctor of your choice, even if healing you might become a
      quite hard job for him.</p>

Hi, there are no links to download the MOD Patches.  I don't know 
if this is the way you want it but I just bought Spyro3 (NTSC-US) 
and I really need the patch.

Thanks       
</pre>
      <p>Even if you are the prototype of an AOL user it should be quite clear for you that you don't need patches for originals.</p>

Sorry but i'm greceiving that msg. when applying the
patch : &quot;PDX-SWD.BIN not found&quot; in Dos;
        &quot;Dateizugriff verweigert&quot; in Win98.

Pls tell me what is wrong and what can I do to apply
it.

Thanks in advance and congratulations for the
fantastic work.

      <p>Not found should be quite clear, &quot;Dateizugriff verweigert&quot; means file access denied. In order to apply it correctly you should make sure that
      the error messages don't appear again.</p>
      <p>Please do yourself a favour <b>not</b> to ignore our warnings in the future or you can find yourself here, too.</p>
