<p align="JUSTIFY">Whatever you might have heard on rumours about a bust or anything else don't believe anything that has <b>not</b>
been confirmed here on Paradox online.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>No</b>, we do <b>not</b> confirm a bust or any names here.<br>
<li><b>No</b>, we do <b>not</b> support any speculations that have been made.<br>
<li><b>No</b>, we would <b>not</b> bring any potentionally busted member under great strain
with a confirmation here. Please respect our statement. We won't give further information about this topic.
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Please stop flooding our contact addresses with inquires regarding this topic and patch requests. We do <b>not</b> have the time nor the <b>interest</b>
in answering them. Be grateful for any releases we decide to publish and do <b>not</b> expect us to work up your wishlists. This won't happen, atleast <b>not</b>
in this life! Accept that or buy originals. Originals work without patches and support your favourite software houses developing further titles. A game worth playing
is a game worth buying.

<p align="JUSTIFY">A big farewell to <font face="PosterBodoni BT">Icarus</font> who has decided to leave the scene for
good. Once again may some of you think. Those of you are unfortunately fatal wrong.
<br>
Furthermore <font face="PosterBodoni BT">AVH</font>
won't waste his talent on cracks, trainer versions or patches anymore. AVH will work exclusively for the demo section in the future. Productions on several platforms are planned. Be patient. Please avoid besieging him with
further requests or you have to take the consequences.
<br>
<font face="PosterBodoni BT">Antiplex</font>, <font face="PosterBodoni BT">Freefall</font>, <font face="PosterBodoni BT">Lukullus</font> and <font face="PosterBodoni BT">YASC</font> are <b>no</b> longer active in Paradox, too. We send a last salute especially to
<font face="PosterBodoni BT">Freefall</font> and <font face="PosterBodoni BT">YASC</font> for their efforts, the loyality and the friendship shown within the ranks of Paradox. Without you it will <b>never</b> be the same again.

<br>
Last but not least <font face="PosterBodoni BT">xor37h</font> has been finally bored of all those stupid patch requests, too. He is taking a larger time-out and is out of order for the next months.<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
We wish all quitting friends and members all the best for their future! Live long and prosper.

<p align="JUSTIFY">Against all rumours Paradox is not dead, won't die in the near future and will continue the work that has been done so far. Some members decided to
retire, some more might follow, but we will have for sure a competitive staff signed on to prove our skills. Check the
<a href="pdx_rels.htm" onmouseover="window.status='Releases'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''" target="right">releases section</a> if you should have any doubts.

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is the <b>very</b> last <blink>warning</blink>:
<b>all</b> requests how to obtain illegal copies of software or how to apply our patches will be forwarded to the responsible authorities, e.g. SCEE.<br>
Remember, in case one of our members has been really busted those e-mail addresses and requests are a sign of good will for cooperation with the authorities.
It is <b>your</b> very own decision! You will bring yourself into deep trouble.

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some more breaking news will follow. Be patient.

Breakdown - Appreciated all the hard work that goes into cracking games. I
want to talk about another issue though. The leader of PDX and I used to get
along quite well, however some lame ass fight amongst some people that I knew
in both groups kinda got everybodys panties in a bunch. My point being is that
only because sometimes you can't stand certain people in a group it doesn't
and shouldn't affect your judgement about others. I highly respect the talent
that you guys have in your group in part because I suck at coding :) However
enough of that. Let us move on leave the lame shit in the past and just focus
on bringing quality PSX games/cracks/trainers to those people too poor to buy
the games so they need us to pay for them. 

RockmanX - PDX seemed to dominate both Coding &amp; PAL Releases this month,
quite a step up from last month. Wip3out was a highly awaited title and
did not disappoint, plus a good early release before the retail date.
The many Cracks were HIGHLY awaited for European Gamers wanting to
copy the originals as well. However, the only complaint about PDX
this month would be the patches for Einhander and Pocket Fighter.
Come on guys, these games are each 1.5-2.5 years old! And not to
mention the USA Versions are out, WTF is the point of patching
the JAP versions? And who do you think still has these around
and wants to play them again trained. Useless patches without
a doubt.. Keep up the good work on the PAL releases and the
Cracks though, The Euro gamers are surely appreciating your
work.

1-LINER: CRACKERS - IN A VERY GOOD WAY!

<p align="JUSTIFY">
So far so good. We are not counting points like others do, but in terms of
justice we are having a closer look at the point system.
<p>

<dl>
<dt><b>1 Point</b></dt>
<dd>PAL/NTSC Selectors or Patches, Trainers, Other Coding works of Art
Good Demos (2nd Discs of games, E3 Demos etc. not those ones that
come with Monthly PSX Mags :)<br>
All of the Multiple Language cracks like German/French etc. (Only
the English Crack will get +2)</dd><p>

<dt><b>-1 Point</b></dt>
<dd>PAL Dupe (Already out in the USA), A Beta or Alpha not labeled as such,
A Bad CD Image that is repacked/fixed by the same group that released the original
Bad Image, An Uncracked Game.</dd>
</dl>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Both trainer versions which were punished with <b>-1 point</b> might be old but are atleast
trainer versions, and trainer versions were absolutely unknown in the PSX scene
before Paradox entered the business.<br>
We do <b>not</b> expect to receive points in that rare cases we execute requests.
We think a <b>0 points</b> rating would be more fitting as according the rules +1 point would be correct
and well deserved.
