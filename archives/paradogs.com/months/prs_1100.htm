Great site guys.
I have used your patches before and you guys are the best.  I just found you 
site and was trying to download Spyro Year of the Dragon NTSC/US anti-mod 
patch.  But all i see is your nfo file but no ppf file.  Is there a reason 
or is it somewhere on another page?

Thanks for the help and keep up the good work.

PS i love the intro graphics and music for Legend of Dragoon.  Sometimes i 
leave it on for awhile and listen to the music.

how do you download them?

Hi guys,
                  I have just used your Sydney 2000 Patch and the 
game seems to crash big time ! It boots up and all is well until 
you actually enter an event ! The backgrounds are non existant, 
some of the events you lose button control completely and on three 
of them some jargon comes up about something has overflowed ! Have 
you had any other probs or am I just a dickhead ! I have the UK PAL 
version and I used PPF O matic to apply the patch ! Can you please 
help !

      <p>Are you waiting or do you want to play? That's not quite clear to me. Nevertheless, buy the original and the waiting or the wish to play can come to an

I have just got hold of a copy of Vagrant Story which has been 
patched at boot up.

But when playing there are strange sounds all through the game 
(walking noises are now beeps)

Could a PPF have ruined the game?

Thankyou for your help

Hello

I am writing to you in hope that you can help me. I am sure you are inundated
with problems so I understand if you cannot reply.
I have a Phillips CD copier and have the supplied software. I have successfully
backed up a few of my Playstation games. I regularly look on the Game Copy World
web site and discovered that for certain games there are protections to prevent you
copying your games successfully. I have a chipped playstation incidentally.
One of the games that you have written a protection fix for is Sydney Olympics.
I downloaded PPF-O-MATIC and the Crack for the game and followed instructions
to apply the fix to the bin file. This successfully updated the file as instructed.
I then burnt the game onto a CD using CDRWin software.
When trying the back up game in my chipped playstation the game booted up and a little 
message from your good selves told me that I had successfully applied the patch and I was 
hopeful that everything was ok. However when getting to the loading screen (3 or 4 pages
into the game) it just freezes up and will not load the game. This is exactly what happens
when I burn the CD without applying the patch. It seems the only difference in the two
back ups with and without your patch is the screen at the beginning saying 'another
great patch from Paradogs etc...'
I wonder if you have any idea what the problem is and if you have come across this before?

I really would appreciate any advice you may have at all.

Thanks

Paul.

            can i use a patch file more than once?, Also once i used the
patch on a game can i copy that patch game as many time or do i have to
keep on applying the patch everytime?

      <p>No! You just bought a licence for one patch attempt. If you are using if twice or even more often you have to pay us 2,000,000.00 US dollars.</p>
