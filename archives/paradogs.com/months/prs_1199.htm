        <td bgcolor="#333333">
          <p align="JUSTIFY">Okay.. i did this trainer just to publish my reply to the unknwon dude at Kalisto, who wrote the RE3 +7 Trainer NFO.. so here my reply:</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">First of all, its funny to see that if you are writing something in your NFO file everyone at <b>Kalisto</b> think its against them.. :D Hey DUDES, <b>not</b> everything is about you.. anyway.. lets start:</p>

          <blockquote>
            "Yes it is really smart to mention that we are yelling at our past in the SNES scene. Is it disturbing for you that we infact got members from the old PARADOX?"
          </blockquote>
          <i>(ed: if you have <b>old</b> members they must be from Paradox because Kalisto and old bites itself)</i> 

          <p align="JUSTIFY">I wrote the "arrogant text" not for Kalisto, I wrote it for some dudes in the #pdxconsole channel (no nicknames here), who tried lie around to get a better reputation and maybe some FTP access.. ;) Thats my answer for this Quote.</p>

          <blockquote>
            "It must be so disturbing that it took you two entire weeks to find the magic 16 BIT KEY in our german crack of DINO CRISIS eh?"
          </blockquote>
          <i>(ed: must be disturbing for people like Kalisto to need three months for figuring out how <b>we</b> cracked <b>real</b> protections <b>first</b> and 10 months for copying methods how to patch, train and link intros. Very impressive. Start thinking before yelling.)</i> 

          <p align="JUSTIFY">?! - The 16 BIT key is <b>different</b> in every version of the games.. (UK, German, Italian, French. etc..) so? erm.. Why should I try to get the KAL German 16 Bit key for the U.K. one? - Huh? Anyway.. I don't know who wrote the textfile.. I guess no coder. So okay.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Yes, it was late.. But you know getting a UK-PAL original for me isn't easy. -&gt; why didnt KAL made this then btw.. ?</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Oh and.. I got the game, I cracked it without any fucking knowledge about Libcrypt. LC2 is a joke, so don't think you are heroes because you can crack it! Hehe this would be like an Amiga crew is proud to be able to crack RNC :) hoho..
          <br>
          <i>(ed: RNC - Rob Norton Cruncher - meant as a short info for people like Kalisto)</i></p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">LC3 is what counts now, like F1'99 PAL or, Spyro 2 etc... I know F1 '99 PAL came from you guys, but <b>not really</b>, because you grabbed T&amp;P when they made it.. ;) so.. let's see for Spyro 2, which is out for two weeks now, too. (<b>where is the Kal crack</b>?) But dont mess with me, DC UK was my first and last crack for Playstation. (so please no "Icarus, we were faster than you stuff etc.." in the NFO) otherwise I have to write a reply again.. ;)</p>

          <blockquote>
            "Then somebody like Titanik and Wildfire released their N64 Trainer Source and guess what.. The next one who released a trainer was YOU... "
          </blockquote>
          <i>(ed: oh, the copy cats claim that other people copied? Contradiction in perfection)</i> 

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Good one, now i tell you something.. you are maybe surprised:</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">1. I made a N64 Cracktro in assembler <b>before</b> Titanik released his docs.. This was used in a game we have released, can't remember the name, sorry, but heh i guess i have some telepathic connection to Titanik so I leeched out his knowledge to make it.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">2. If you would know about R4000 asm-code&amp;n64 hardware and would take a look at the sources Titanik released you will see that just the graphic routines are left there (see statemant above). So it was no use for me. I coded the hook routine and stuff myself etc... but blah.. seems you don't know nothing about the N64 and the N64-Scene so .. next time.. forget to mention this.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Greetings, Titanik and Wildfire at this point btw;-) See ya in IRC, dudes.</p>

          <p>In the same time this two statements above are my answer to your Quote:</p>

          <blockquote>
            "You are no BILL GATES, no NELSON MANDELA or whatever, so that it allows you to mix into things you simply don't understand."
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">It seems that you mix some stuff you don't understand, too ahaha ;)</p>

          <blockquote>
            "All you should do isn't twisting facts.. And fact is... Currently we are unstoppable!"
          </blockquote>
          <i>(ed: wow. We are deeply impressed. Get a life far away from behind the screen. The real world can be more exciting than just being unstoppable copying PSX games. Yes, life is more than just using CDRWin. You will see when you will become once adult persons. So long enjoy your puberty behind the screen.)</i> 

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Yes, seems so.. but huh.. I really don't care who is the best in the PlayStation scene.. - time is over for me to care. ;) I am no leader anymore..</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">All my friends know: in the year 2000 I am off, and then you can compete with your grandfather or someone else. I will finally concetrate a little bit more on my life!</p>

          <p>Aynway, cheers to you, whoever you are, unknown stranger!</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Well, just read yourself what Kalisto wrote in one of their recent releases.</p>

          <blockquote>
            Last but not least.. Cisco of Kalisto likes to pay respect to AVH/PARADOX, who by the way proved that there are still some real sceners around. As he used to train the german Dino Crisis Store Final, he included the Kalisto Crack.

            <p>He didn't removed the intro and let come up AMIGA like fashion, where the trainer group doesn't touches the crack of the Cracking group and includes their intro. Fine job. We are seeing this as a step to lay down any difference between us and PDX. We can only have good words for such an attitude.</p>

            <p>There are several other guidelines out of the old days, which were laid down on ice in the PSX scene. One of them is, that if a trainer already got released, the player doesn't needs a trainer which has 3 more options. If you can do a mega trainer it is alright to release it. But a megatrainer isn't anything below +10 options. I hope finally also this guidelines get regarded. We would never come to the thought that it is wise to release a +8 version of a trainer if PDX already released a +5.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">It is quite nice to see that <b>Middy</b>, ah sorry Cisco/Kalisto, respects the everlasting and innovative work of our members, especially in the cracking, training and patching area. That kind of behaviour can not really specified as the typical Kalisto behaviour from our point of view. We respect that either.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">We just wanted to let all know, and that evem includes Kalisto, that we do <b>not</b> spread our news just for the fun of it. AVH really <b>quit</b> the illegal a couple of weeks ago and definately won't return to this kind of job. He prefers, like many other members of Paradox, the legal activities in form of intro and demo coding &lt;hint&gt; in our very promising demo section that will be active on PC and PlayStation and is lead by the unforgotten <font face="PosterBodoniBT">Maximilien</font>.
          <br>
          <b>Redneck</b> is a new member who infact trained Dino Crisis. We would really appreciate it if the members who deserve the respect would earn it themselves and <b>not</b> others - especially <b>not</b> the ones who have quitted the illegal activities for some good reasons.

 All I can say is Germany releases some strange games.  Good thing they're
 usually playable though :)  What's weird about this one is you move around
 a small blue elephant and a larger creature to solve getting out of each
 screen's obstacles.  Interesting game.

 - Amptor/Oldskool


 I have not gotten a chance to play this game. But why only one release
 by Paradox? They have so many warez releases a month...to bad they can't
 release as many GBC games as PC and PSX games!

 - Skates/Independent


 A nice 3d isometric game from PDX, not quite Head over Heels though..
  
 - Thallium/Independent


 This game really kicks ass...it was a real surprise to see this one come
 from PDX, but a welcome one!  The game is very like "Head over Heels" by
 Ocean from the 8-bit (home-computer!) days...a nice release, but again a
 fairly quiet month from PDX.
