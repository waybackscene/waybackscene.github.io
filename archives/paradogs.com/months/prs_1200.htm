    Hi Hope You Can Help Me.
I Have Been trying for some time now to apply a patch to a PSX game 
but dont fully uderstand what i am doing.
I Followed the instructions from psx backupworld,downloaded the 
ppf-o-matic  program  and an evaluation copy of cdr-win,and the patch 
i required for medievil 2 but i just cant do it.

I was wondering if you could send me some sort of step by step idiots 
guide. the bit that throws me is as follows (from psx backupworld)...
Extract the patch archive to the path containing the cd image file.
Open a dos box/ms-dos prompt and change directory to the path containing 
the cd image file (and Patch).
Patch the cd image file by executing ppf patch engine etc etc

I dont understand any of this..what does it all mean ?
(im not to good with dos im afraid)

The closest i came to getting it right was when i used ppf-o-matic to 
apply a patch  for spyro 2 i think it was...it returned with &quot;patch 
applied ok&quot;.when i went  to write it back to a cd all i  got was the 
patch,no game  and the writer/system locked up ???

I was hoping to do medievil 2 this evening but when i searched for the 
patch i could'nt  find a ppf file.I downloaded what i assumed was a 
protection and trainer patch from psx backupworld...do i need to keep 
it zipped ???

Just for the record i have &quot;backed up&quot; over 200 games using nero but none 
with cdr-win hence never  used patches before.

I know an idiots guide is a lot to ask for but could you please at least 
let me know where  i'm going  wrong.

Many thanks,
Snake.</pre>
      <p>Well, Snake, at first nobody cares about you being successfull or unsuccessfull applying or patches. We get thousands of stupid mails like this one. Do

      <p>At first, I don't think you have enough money to buy our universal patcher. Secondly I doubt he will like it to be sold. In fact, he doesn't like
      patching and cracking that much anymore. He prefers coding these days. I can fully understand it. For whom should he patch?<br>
      If you are dumb enough to buy pirated software it's your very own problem! Paradox Console has not sold and won't sell pirated software.</p>

Hi Dedicated Coders,

Nice web site, brings back fond memorys of my A3000!

I came across your web site while surfing for fixes to my Jap PS2 (sad git who 
couldnt wait for UK PS2)!  Anyway I am a proud owner of PS2 with may Japanese 
games. However now I have purchased few PS2 PAL games  here in UK and cant get 
them to play on my nice PS2 (which is JAP NTSC PS2 with modchip of some sort 
applied). 
It is infurating me... I have purchaed UK PAL Smugglers Run and Time Splitters. 
And these wont run om my PS2.

I have a CD writer and have been desperatly scouring on the NET to find ways to 
make these two games work on my Jap PS2.

Any help would be appericated!

Thanks and keep up the good work...

i really like your site and the design is great! The group is the fastest and best

And therefore my question: Could u guys write a history of PARADOX?? Because i'm

me) how has all the shit began.

Your're the best scene group, don't forget to be proud, hehe!!!

Hi dudes!

I am using your ppf-patches, and most of the times, it works alright. The 
PPF-engine is easy to use, but I´m not sure if it worked in Sydney2000. I 
patched the game, and it loaded perfect in our PSX-console, 
but the graphics were real strange, and in javelin, the background were 
black.  The movements of the  competitor were also real strange. You said 
Sydney2000 were  fully protected, but the size of the patch-file were only 
55kb. The patch for TOCA  was much bigger, what is the diffrent?
Can you explain how I can get the PDX-patch to work? I dont understand what 
you mean, my english isn´t that good.

Kindly regards from Sweden

IS THIS FAKE????????

My GRANNY could patch better than this! When in PAL mode the game is
completely UNPLAYABLE, the arrows are completely out of time with the
music, in fact on most tracks the fucking music has finished before the
arrows have finished scrolling (in case you didn`t know, the object of
the game is to hit the arrows IN TIME with the music!) Its unplayable in
NTSC too, on a PAL machine, even on scart tv etc.

Tell me this isn`t true! From a group like PARADOX, one of the most
respected on the PSX scene?!?!

Can you guys create a PPF-O-Matic v2.0 for Adaptec Easy CD Creator?  
Because  you guys have one for CDRWIN and it is kinda hard for me to 
use it. It is a shareware I have to copy at 1x. Come on paradogs create 
some new shit.
       </pre>
      <p>Unworthy AOL user. If you are too stupid to use CDRWIN then buy the originals. Do you really think we would make us so much work for a creep like you?
      Furthermore we are PARADOX and not paradogs, stupid idiot. Listen to the voice of Buddha who once said that you will never reach the level to be allowed
      to contact the ones you will obey for the rest of your poor life.</p>

a problem, i cant find my bin for NHL2001, what is it?

please reply to jospy007@hotmail.com

      <p>Well, bin files love to hide themselves our carpets or outside in the grass. Look out for them. Do not step on them. Thanks in advance. Remember: save
      the bins.</p>

I have a question, and im asking this because I dident see a 
troubleshooting guide anywhere. I have ppf-O-matic ver 2.0 and 
cdr-win ver 3.8a. i have patch-antimod for 3 games, grind session, 
resident evil survivor, and cool boarders 2001. when I use cdrwin 
to make bin files and use the  patcher, it says its patched sucessfully 
and then I burn to a cd. The process is done and when I use the cd the 
ist screen comes up ok (white screen) then when the sony screen comes 
up it stays  on that screen. have any thoughs on what this could 
be.....
email, Lucks143@hotmail.com
thanx.

Betreff: Crash Bash Patch does not work
Date: Friday, 29. December 2000 11:58

Hi,

I tried to use the PPF archive pdx-cbcr.zip (12/02/2K) to patch the image of the
PSX game Crash Bash. Unfortunately the game doesn't start:-(
I have used CDRWIN 3.7 to create the image and PPF-O-MATIC 2.0 have reported
success. Are you shure that this patch works?
         
</pre>
      <p>No idea since I do not use copies. I just use originals and so should you.</p>

      <p>Hey man, if you don't know how to play, man, how should be help you? You don't have the time to swap the CDs? But you have enough time to play? Are you
      sure? Since swapping the disks should take less time than playing.<br>
      Regarding the BAD address: in case things work wrong for them just write to any Italian jailhouse and the mail will be forwarded. Let's hope the best for
      them.</p>

Guys,
The PPF patch for Crash Bash disables the option to choose more than one
player in tournament mode !!

My kids are not happy that it's only a single player when using the backup
copy ( I won't let them use the originals as they get broken to easy)

Can we have a fix please

Thanks
Phil          
</pre>
      <p>I guess your kids would accept a working original, too. Okay, it's what cool without a Paradox intro, but heck. The kids only care if it works or not.</p>
      <p>Please do yourself a favour <b>not</b> to ignore our warnings in the future or you can find yourself here, too.</p>
