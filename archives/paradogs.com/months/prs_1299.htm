            Well one may wonder at first when seeing this released, How the hell exactly DID PDX get a USA Original?! Well the truth would be, they DIDN'T. SaGa Frontier 2 PAL was a game KALISTO has had since November 18th
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">First of all, we did fuck up. Yes! It is definately a PAL release and <b>not</b> an US-version. Damned. It was a stupid fault from the supplier. We have to confirm that we released the PAL version and not the NTSC US-version. True. We have <b>no</b> problem to confirm mistakes we did. We are adult persons and can surely handle things like that. But we released it first, that that is the point we presume that scares the big-mouthed kindergarden to death. And all we get in reply is a bunch of lame offences without any background. It is really sad to see how the self-titled owners of the scene act. One could really feel sorry about them.</p>

          <blockquote>
            So, PARADOX has just repacked the exact same BIN that KALISTO has had since November 18th using a shell. They did not even modify the fucking filedates or the CRC. It is exactly the same as the BIN KALISTO had. When questioned about this PARADOX completely refused to co-operate and had that sign of guilt in themselves.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">We are indeed amused. But wait, if you are so kind to send us your real names and addresses of your kindergarden we will be pleased to send a psychatrist, hoping that it might <b>not</b> be too late for you?</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Do you guys have a special version that was created exclusively for you? Is it possible that Paradox has actually US sources?
          <br>
          The only proof brought along by the scum was nothing else but a stupid text sequence comparing a date and a size. That is indeed very impressive. We have to admit that. That are really facts nobody can deny. Damned, we have been trapped.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">We have <b>no</b> interest in cooperating with Kalisto because it's more valueable to talk to a wall instead. We are finally bored of Kalisto's behaviour and sick claimings. We prefer to communicate with adult persons to have a good discussion with interesting contents.</p>

          <blockquote>
            Yes, The PARADOX release is a FAKE. It is NOT a USA Final with a Crack aside it. When you get KALISTO RAR's you would generally think they are coming from the USA, and stupid thieves that don't bother to test shit
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">The release is <b>not</b> definately no USA version and surely <b>not</b> a fake. It is simply mislabeled. Ofcourse the Paradox version is a full working PAL version. Mistakes can happen. We are all human and have other, more important things to do.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">If your release is said to be a fake only, what is the defination for yours? On the one hand you claim that we have stolen <b>your</b> version and on the other hand <b>our</b> version is supposed to be a fake? Does <b>not</b> make much sense again.
          <br>
           Let me short repeat what Kalisto tries to implant: the ISOs from Paradox and Kalisto were completely identical but the version from Paradox is a fake because Paradox put it out <b>infront</b> of Kalisto. We are still searching for the sense. If you have found it, please remember to report us about your results. Many thanks in advance.</p>

          <blockquote>
            get a smack in the head when they do something like this! The game is Swoop/PARADOX tried to patch this BIN to work in NTSC Mode, To make this seem like a legit USA Release. But of course he failed miserably and the rest of PARADOX is uncoordinated so they left it labeled as a USA Game. When you select NTSC Mode in the PAL-NTSC Selector built into the crack it still displays in PAL, Fine work guys!
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Our PAL release remains a PAL release. We can only repeat it again and again. Indeed it was a damned fine piece of work from Swoop. He has only removed the protection. It's a proper working crack. That is infact all he did so there is <b>no</b> need to complain. In case he would have released a patch allowing PAL/NTSC mode it would have been stated seperately in the NFO document. He did <b>not</b> attempt to patch the games like Kalisto claims. Damn, only lame accuses without a kind of truth or reality in it. Wow, that is so impressive.</p>

          <blockquote>
            So, Now we are here to bring you the PAL Original that was supplied by ourselves, and NOT stolen from other groups. It is fully PAL-NTSC Selectable &amp; CRACKED. It is a clean BIN and no separate patches need
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Paradox supplies all Paradox titles, otherwise they would <b>not</b> be Paradox titles. Oh dear, how low can people go?</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">How about your pathetic insults of wasting bandwidth by releasing a full ISO that has already been released before? The Paradox version works fine on PAL so the only acceptable release from Kalisto would have been a PAL/NTSC selector. But it seems to hurt badly that Paradox has been a bit faster this time. Or are that the points you are looking for? For sure.
          <br>
          Do you really think and take it as a preference that all people reading your fairy tales are as braindead as the authors of your NFO texts? Do you really think people are that stupid? Poor guys.</p>

          <blockquote>
            to be applied to it. And no, this is NOT a USA Final and we don't mislabel our games to look like something they are not! :)
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">You guys continously claim to have any skills, so we know you claim to be something you are not. You have fast Internet connections, live in the USA and can work with CDRWin in case the printed manual is opened for research. That's a fact. Sad but true. Seems that your major skill are the big-mouthed persons continously flooding the scene with their stupid pseudo-facts. Would be more impressive to see if you would spare your energy for quality releases instead of wasting so much time in spreading lame accuses. Get real, grow and wake up.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">On could really wonder if those kids will once grow up and discover the real life instead of wasting their lives (do they actually know the true meaning outside of computer games?). Here they go again. Level 1:</p>

          <blockquote>
            game is NOT protected in anyway. All this game contains is a bug which does not allow it to work on PAL PlayStations. Now Now, KALISTO does NOT intend our USA - NTSC release's to be used on PAL PSX's. Nor do we intend our EUROPE/UK - PAL release's to be fully compatible with USA PSX's. Generally
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">The Paradox version works fine on PAL. So this bug was definately <b>removed</b> by Mr. Sandman.</p>

          <blockquote>
            Users can play the game properly. The game does NOT have a Mod Chip protection like the cluebies at PARADOX have stated in their recent NFO. It also does NOT have a LibCrypt or similar copy protection.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            Then after the PARADOX screwup with the 'Cracked' image, iNTERGANG put out a crack for the game which they mislabeled. They said that it does not change anything but actually it does make the KALISTO image working on PAL PlayStation's. After this PARADOX duped the Patch and put out the same thing.. Very lame. The last thing that seems a little lame about this
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Just a short question: did you exactly understand what the people in Kalisto try to explain here? Paradox patched the full version, <b>after</b> our version came the Intergang version and then Paradox duped the Intergang patch file? Sounds very reliable and makes as much sense as most other garbage coming from them.</p>

          <blockquote>
            release is the fact that PARADOX put Supplier: Team PDX on both of their releases. Stop fooling around gimps, You have 0 members located in the US of A and just leech KALISTO images to train/crack/fix. Give
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Team PDX or Team Paradox releases around 60% of all Paradox releases. There are only a few suppliers requesting to be named with their handle. Team PDX supplied a lot of firsts and they should be all from Kalisto to train/crack/fix.
          <br>
          We actually do have some members in the United States. Next time check your sources. But most of your weak insults do not have a real background. We look forward to Scream IV, starring the kiddies of Kalisto shouting and shouting without anyone taking a further notice.</p>

          <blockquote>
            Take a look at following routine and tell us if this is a fix or a crack: 
<pre>
 8003fd24     beq v0,zero,$8003fd34
 8003fd28     nop
 8003fd2c     j   $8003fd2c    -&gt; make a nop out of it -&gt; fixed!
 8003fd30     nop
 8003fd34     lw  ra,$0010(sp)
 8003fd38     addiu sp,sp,$18
 8003fd3c     jr ra
</pre>
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Oh. Once again Kalisto proved that they are skilled rippers and can only abuse the sources of other people. Did you actually wonder how it came that the kids in Kalisto actually learnt coding, training and cracking almost a year after us? Without stealing our sources and methods they would be still happy that they can actually insert a CD in the PlayStation to run a game.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Concerning the topic fix or crack we'd like to point out that some people define a simple patch to be a crack, others call it a hack and you describe it as a fix. What is the correct defination. You guys want to define the correct definations? Do you really think you are in the position to do so?
          <br>
          In the meantime we will polish Mr. Sandman's English. Then we will look further.</p>

          <blockquote>
            This is stupid! Wasting bandwidth, wasting the credits of the people who are actually downloading the warez and who maybe also do trust your words. Only to fetch points in the charts? Why don't you try to release a USA game before US instead of earning your points by actions, we don't like to comment here!
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">As we actually who is shouting here we only can have a bright, bright smile in our faces. Isn't Kalisto the gang uploading uncracked images who has proven who is exactly seeking for points.
          <br>
          Regarding the topic wasting bandwidth we'd like to refer to <font face="PosterBodoni BT">Saga Frontier 2</font>. Trapped in your own words. Nice try. We wish you more luck next time.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Wasting bandwidth with that one release is the only thing we can get blamed for. A short patchfile would have been enough. We admit that but nothing else!</p>

          <blockquote>
            beat and that's that. You don't go release another crack 12 hours later 'Just for people who want our logo on the game' like you did for
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Actually we do receive countless requests of people asking for Paradox versions since they do not trust the Kalisto versions. Furthermore you guys claim to have some background in the SNES scene then we do really wonder that you have not recognized yet that there have been always multiple trainer and crack versions of different teams.
          <br>
          We give a damn fuck if you count or punish them in your cheated charts system. We do it for the fun of it. Not to own anyone or stun someone else. And that is the big difference to you guys.</p>

          <blockquote>
            We can somewhat understand this behavior with many of your top notch coders being inactive &amp; the very sad shape that your group is in right now. We wish you better luck in the future.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Well, Paradox has still a lot of talented coders in the team like e.g. <b>Swoop</b> in first case who definately knows much more about programming than Team Kalisto's &quot;knowledge&quot; altogether. We guess you have already sneaked through his source-codes as they are still lightyears ahead comparing the quality between his and your intros.
          <br>
          Furthermore we can proudly name Mr. Bengali, Redneck, Chocobo and ofcourse good old Icarus who drops in once in a while, too. Most of them have proven their skills in other scenes and platforms before Kalisto members found the power switch for the PlayStation, not to talk about developing something <b>on their own</b>. Oh dear. Stop dreaming and get real.</p>

          <p>Regards,</p>
