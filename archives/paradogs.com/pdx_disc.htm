      have found your path to the Paradox console homepage.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Please note that this homepage is <b>not</b> destinated to be a warez site <b>nor</b> does it support trading pirated software. <b>Not</b>
      even a single document of this homepage does contain information where to find or how to obtain illegal copies of copyrighted software in order to support
      software piracy.<br>
      <br>
      All those documents on this homepage have been stored by the demo section of Paradox. Never forget that the demo section has <b>no</b> connection to the
      so-called warez scene so we <b>can't</b> and <b>won't</b> answer any questions out of this area. This site is supposed to contain information about the
      group Paradox, to be more precise about the console and demo sections. The following documents have been developed for information purposes only. The
      responsible persons behind this site have <b>no</b> relationship to the activities of a group called Paradox on PC.&nbsp;<br>
      The <b>console</b> and <b>demo</b> sections of Paradox [PDX] have their roots in the Amiga scene with a couple of former Paradox Amiga members who are now
      operating using new, &quot;unknown&quot; handles for several reasons. Having the unforgotten <b>Maximilien</b>, who is taking care about the legal aspects
      of the group, back in our rows should be evidence enough to convince all doubter that we are the <strong>genuine</strong> Paradox.<br>

      obtain pirated software. These requests <b>won't</b> be answered and forwarded to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) without hesitation.<br>
      All for download purposed offered archives on this site contain from Paradox developed or improved tools, so-called demos, so-called intros, music modules
      or graphics. In other worlds, totally <b>legal</b> content only. You <b>won't</b> find any PAL/NTSC patches, trainer versions or cracks here.<br>
