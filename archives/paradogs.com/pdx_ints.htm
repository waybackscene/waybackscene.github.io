      <font size="4">The history of a Legend.</font>
      <p><b>We must start this Paradox history by quoting our famous slogan, stolen many times by other groups, but that doesn't apply better to any of them
      than Paradox: Legends sleep, but they never die!</b>
      <p>In fact, although Paradox faced many crisis through its life, the group always was able to come back stronger from these challenges.
      <p><center><font size="4">I – The Beginning, 1990-1991:</font></center></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="thumbs/thb_fuck.jpg" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="1" alt="Screenshot" width="160" height="100">In the beginning there was two
      groups. <b>Trilogy</b>, a mostly Danish group with some of the best crackers around, and <b>M.A.D.</b>, French in majority, with some of the best
      suppliers around. You got the picture: There was in place all you needed to create the best group around, and <b>Paradox</b> was born. Add to that a
      creative demo section responsible for many works, notably the Angels Fucktro, probably the most famous intro ever done on any support, and you are
      assisting to the birth of a true scene legend. <b>Midnight Maniac</b> and <b>Olivier</b> were running the group, while <b>BlackHawk</b> (don't try
      counting his cracks, this is the most prolific cracking machine Earth has ever seen) and <b>The Surge</b> handled cracking. Key suppliers were <b>Action
      Man</b> and<b> Spirit</b>, with the help of <b>Paragon</b>. Paradox was strong, very strong, thanks to its many characters in the group. But when you have
      so many of them in the same team, tension arises, and that was the reason of the split that put Paradox in a sleep that lasted a couple of years.
      <p><center><font size="4">II - Total World Domination 1993-1994:</font></center></p>
      <p>The legend was asleep, but when some old members got back together, it was ready for what is the most dominating spell a group ever enjoyed. With
      Midnight Maniac back but with somehow a low profile, Blackhawk strong as ever, and Paragon still supplying the majors, Maximilien had no problem leading
      the group to new heights. New addition like Zool to manage the group, and Lincoln as German fastest contributed to the fast leader position of Paradox in
      the Amiga scene.
      <p><img border="0" src="thumbs/thb_snes.jpg" alt="Screenshot" align="left" hspace="3" vspace="1" width="160" height="100">But that wasn't enough, Paradox
      wanted more, and as Amiga, the machine that started it all, was losing of its power, new challenges were needed. Consoles were next. Genesis and SNES were
      hot and new, and Paradox releasing power was completely unleashed to a humiliating (for the rest of the scene) 90% of all releases, to be credited to the
      coding skills of Belgarion and the management talent of Papillon.
      <p>Time to enjoy success and relax? No way! P.C. the most hated machine for the true elite was obviously going to take over. Time for Paradox to show the
      P.C. scene who the big boys are. With the same team, and the help of the kindergarden level of P.C. protection, Paradox took over in no time. Paradox was
      on his way to a true domination of this machine when their leader got busted, a bust that put the legend in its sleep once more, as well as most of the
      scene.
      <p>To imagine the power of Paradox during those times, you don't need to believe our well known slogan, 'Total World Domination', you just can check out
      some old World Charts. They were the scene independent rating system, check them out in 1994:</center> &nbsp;<br>

      <p>You can see it was true: Paradox – Total World Domination!
      <p><center><font size="4">III - The New Generation, 1997-Today:</font></center></p>
      <p><img border="0" src="thumbs/thb_newg.jpg" alt="Screenshot" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="1" width="160" height="100">With its original leader behind
      bar for adding hacking to the cracking until 2000, Paradox needed some fresh blood. Some old Paradude demo section member by the name of Hein proved that
      being a great coder and a great manager are not incompatible. And also that the Paradox school is the best one to bring up those talents. Together with
      the help of a real coding army, they took the console scene to a brand new level a development. And this is resume in their undisputed slogan: 'Innovate,
      Don't Imitate'. With the added pleasure for the fans of the numerous old school intros that bring back Amiga memories, and the always present Paradox seal
      of quality.
      <p>This is history, and we won't talk here of the many characters that make the legend today, and their new achievements, but their name will be added
      soon to this history of your favourite team. Come back later, today, history is in the making with some new releases.
      <p><center><font size="4">IV - The competition:</font></center>
      <p>Paradox loves competition, because at the ends, it always win. :)
      <p>Many groups challenged Paradox through time, and once more there is a famous Paradox slogan to resume it all: 'Mess with the Best, Die like the Rest!'
      <p>Consequence of a too strong competition, many groups got killed. Some of the famous wars between Paradox and teams like Angels, Classic, The Company,
      Prodigy, Hoodlum, Rom Kids ended with the same results, and you never found any Paradox blood on the floor. Some were a little wiser, like Crystal. They
      listen to the saying 'if you can't beat them, join them', but not every group were offered such a chance.
      <p>We must also name here TRSI, our friends, whose ranks supplied some great people to Paradox. If Paradox has the best team around, TRSI has the best
      friends around. We must also talk about Fairlight, the group that gave Paradox the best competition it ever faced, and survived it. The groups are on
      different machines now, the challenge that can only be found on consoles got Paradudes in love with these machines. But you can expect one day that
      Paradox will jump back on P.C. to give to their respected competitors the challenge they need to take that scene to new heights.
      <p>Today, Paradox is still facing some tough competition. But be sure of this: ten years from now, this history page will be longer, Paradox will still be
      ruling, and today competition will be gone.
      <p><center><font size="4">V - The Hall of fame:</font></center>
      <p>During its history, Paradox has seen many great individual fill its ranks. These people were all very different, but they all had in common some
      principles that still run the group today:<br>
