      been active on computer systems just like the Commodore 64, the Commodore Amiga and ofcourse on PC who accepted the challenge to prove their skills by
      removing copy protections which were desired to forestall software piracy. In the evolution of the strange world and sub-culture called scene it became a
      standart to mark the own releases with a short info screen and later on with remarkable masterpieces called intros, containing stunning effects, graphics
      and musics that were even able to outclass the quality level of the release itself.</p>
      <p>Before Paradox decided to participate in the Sony PlayStation scene those fine crack intros have been sadly missed.</p>
      <p><img src="thumbs/thb_in64.jpg" alt="N64 Intro preview" align="left" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="160" height="100">Later on, with the rising difficulty
      level of the games, people have started to look out for cheat modes. Sometimes the skilled programmers have allowed to active one of those cheats by
      pressing predefined key combinations. However, there have only been a very few games containing those options. Therefore the crackers accepted the
      challenge to allow the user choosing the right one, or even all cheat modes, out of several options to complete the games. Some games have been by far
      over and double trained in the seek to break new records. However, pirated copies became more comfortable than the originals.</p>
      <p>Before Paradox decided to participate in the Sony PlayStation scene those useful and advanced trainer versions have been sadly missed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Paradox is well known for the releases on PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Gameboy Color, Nintendo 64 and last but not least Dreamcast. Next on
      the list are e.g. more handhelds like Gameboy Advanced, NeoGeo Pocket and any other promising new console platform.</p>
      <p>Our philosophy is more than just creating 1:1 copies. Paradox is here to bring back old memories, memories we all coming from different computer and
      console platforms did love to remember. It's the spirit of the oldschool, the desire to produce and distribute quality software on the highest possible
      level.</p>
      <p>If you have already proven your skills to PAL/NTSC patch, to apply useful trainer functions amd to crack console games on the current scene platforms
      (PSX, PS2, GBC and DC) please do <b>not</b> hesitate to contact the <a href="mailto:staff@paradogs.com" onmouseover="window.status='Organisation'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''">organsation</a>
      if you'd love to become a part of the team that introduced it all to the PSX and PS2 scene. We are always looking for <b>motivated</b> and <b>skilled</b>
      people to support our activities. Don't hesitate - act now - just take your chance.</p>
