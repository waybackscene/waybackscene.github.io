  |    Whatever you might have heard on rumours about a bust or anything     |
  |    else  don't  believe anything that has not been confirmed here on     |

  |       * NO, we would not bring any potentionally busted  member          |
  |         under  great  strain  with  a confirmation here. Please          |
  |         respect  our   statement.   We   won't   give   further          |

  |    we  decide  to  publish  and  do  not  expect  us to work up your     |
  |    wishlists. This won't happen, atleast not in  this  life!  Accept     |
  |    that or buy originals. Originals work without patches and support     |
  |    your favourite software houses developing further titles. A  game     |
  |    worth playing is a game worth buying.                                 |

  |    A big farewell to ICARUS who has decided to leave the  scene  for     |
  |    good.  Once  again  may  some  of  you  think.  Those  of you are     |
  |    unfortunately fatal wrong.                                            |
  |    Furthermore  AVH  won't  waste  his  talent  on  cracks,  trainer     |
  |    versions  or  patches  anymore. AVH will work exclusively for the     |
  |    demo section in the future. Productions on several platforms  are     |
  |    planned.  Be  patient.  Please  avoid  besieging him with further     |
  |    requests or you have to take the consequences.                        |
  |    ANTIPLEX, FREEFALL, LUKULLUS, THE  UNDERTAKER  and  YASC  are  no     |
  |    longer active in Paradox, too.                                        |
  |    Last but not least XOR37H has been finally  bored  of  all  those     |
  |    stupid patch requests, too. He is taking a larger time-out and is     |
  |    out of order for the next months.                                     |
  |                                                                          |
  |    We wish all quitting friends and members all the best  for  their     |
  |    future! Live long and prosper.                                        |
  |                                                                          |
  |    Against all rumours Paradox is not dead, won't die  in  the  near     |
  |    future and will continue the work that has been done so far. Some     |
  |    members decided to retire, some more might follow,  but  we  will     |
  |    have  for sure a competitive staff signed on to prove our skills.     |
  |                                                                          |
  |    Some more breaking news will follow. Be patient.                      |
