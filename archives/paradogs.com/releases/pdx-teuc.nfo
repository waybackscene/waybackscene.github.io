   |       Elephants are considered to be among the most intelligent |
   | mammals probably ranking behind dolphins and the higher primates|
   | Groups of  elephants have  highly established social frameworks |
   | and sophisticated communication calls.  Young animals are cared |
   | for within an extended  family structure and  groups of animals |
   | will co-operate in  searching out food and water when these are |
   | scarce.                                                         |
   |  The elephant's tusks  consist of ivory  a material  which like |
   | chitin or cellulose is organic but not "alive" per se. The tusks|
   | are used to retrieve food to dig  for water and occasionally to |
   | fight.  Elephants  with no  natural predators  are nevertheless |
   | hunted by poacher who sell off ivory to fuel the trade in stupid|
   | trinkets for those pathetic people who like that sort of thing. |
   | Frequently  elephants are not  killed outright  by poachers but |
   | merely disabled. Tusks are  severed at the  root and the animal |
   | left to  die often in  extreme pain. The trade in  ivory is now |
   | banned  by CITES  except under a few special  circumstances but |
   | this unfortunately has only acted to drive it underground.      | 
   |                                                                 |
