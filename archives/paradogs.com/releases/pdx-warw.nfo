  |  First the book, then the album, now the game, the story continues.      |
  |  This is a new strategy game for the Jeff Wayne lovers, and all other    |
  |  strategy freaks. Apart from the solid gameplay, it has also got         |
  |  a great sound track.                                                    |
  |  The story is wellknown. Ugly marsians set coordinates for planet        |
  |  Earth, and then invade Britain (don't ask me why Britain, guess they    |
  :  want beef..) It's up to you to kick their green asses.                  :

  | CNG & PDX merged to become even stronger then both parts of the group    |
  | have been on their own. There is a lot of stuff on its way to see the    |
  | daylight. We are pretty sure you know where to keep an eye on. And now   |
  | just go, rise and reverberate us!                                        |

  | And against all rumours and KALISTO´s weak attempt to gain attention...  |
  | We do not call ourselves CARNADOX, that´s just the lame equivalent to    |
  | Intergang from KALISTO. KALISTO=INTERGANG=CARNADOX, great deal eh?!      |
